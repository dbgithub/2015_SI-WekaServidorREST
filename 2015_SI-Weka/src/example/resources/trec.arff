light underparts, both with darker\n \n streaking. they have a white eye ring and a long dark brown tail which shows\n \n white outer feathers in flight.\n \n \n \n their breeding habitat is open grassy areas across most of north america. the\n \n nest is an open cup on the ground under a clump of grass.\n \n \n \n these birds migrate to the southern and central united states and mexico.\n \n \n \n these birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects and seeds. outside of\n \n the nesting season, they often feed in small flocks.\n \n \n \n the male sings from a higher perch, such as a shrub or fencepost, to indicate\n \n his ownership of the nesting territory. the musical song begins with two pairs\n \n of repeated whistled notes and ends in a series of trills, somewhat similar to\n \n that of the song sparrow.\n \n \n \n this bird s numbers are declining in the eastern parts of its range due to\n \n habitat loss.\n \n \n \n references\n \n    database entry includes

aircraft see   for\n \n the american academic competition see   \n \n \n  decathlon  is an athletic event combining  track and field events. events are\n \n held over two consecuative days and the winners are determined by the combined\n \n performance in all events. performance is judged on a points system in each\n \n event, not by the position achieved. the decathlon is contested by male\n \n athletes, while female athletes contest the heptathlon.\n \n \n \n the decathlon is a menu of athletic events, testing an individual   s speed,\n \n endurance, strength, skill, and personality. the word is of greek origin  deka\n \n    . the decathlon includes five events on each of  \n successive days. the first day schedules the  meter run, long jump, shot put,\n \n high jump, and  meters. it is a day of speed, explosive power, and jumping\n \n ability. day  consists of the  meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin,\n \n and  meters. the importance of this day is on technique and endurance.\n \n \n \n events day  \n \n \n \n        m\n \n       long jump\n \n       shot put\n \n       high jump\n \n        m\n \n \n \n day  \n \n \n \n        hurdles\n \n       discus throw\n \n       pole vault\n \n       javelin throw\n \n        m\n \n \n \n origins the event sprouted from the ancient game pentathlon. pentathlon is a\n \n game that was played at the ancient greek olympics. pentathlons involved five\n \n games     long jump, discus throw, javelin, sprint and a wrestling match.\n \n introduced in olympia during  bc, the game was extremely popular for many\n \n centuries. by the  century bc, pentathlons became part of religious games.\n \n \n \n gorgos, from elis town near olympia was a four time pentathlon winner during the\n \n period. another key player was lampis, a young spartan who was the first olympic\n \n winner. automedes was also a known player of the time. the last recorded game\n \n winner was publius asklepiades of corinth in ad  roman emperor theodosius i\n \n officially put an end to the game in ad  by closing down all the sanctuaries\n \n including olympia.\n \n \n \n  the mid  various versions of the game emerged. the  olympics\n \n endorsed a new implication to the game. seventeen year old mathias emerged as\n \n the then decathlon winner, banishing the myth that decathlon was a game for the\n \n old and the experienced. mathias still remains the youngest decathlon sports\n \n champion in olympic history.\n \n \n \n modern standardization in  the international amateur athletic federation\n \n  iaaf  laid out new scoring tables and brought about some standardization in the\n \n game. the  saw the game spreading to the eastern european nations, mainly\n \n the soviet union, poland and east germany.\n \n \n \n to ancient greeks and modern germans, the decathlon performer was and is the\n \n king of athletes. but to most of the track world, including the united states,\n \n the decathlete is a sometime hero, recognized and applauded only when he wins\n \n the olympic games. hero or forgotten man, the  event performer is a rare and\n \n unique breed.\n \n \n \n the first decathlon competition was held on a single day, october   in\n \n gothenburg, sweden. this was technically not the first decathlon, but one of the\n \n first two, as germany also held a decathlon on the very same day. the germans\n \n contested their events in the same order but with a different scoring table. so,\n \n the first decathlon world record holder was the winner of the first completed\n \n meet. karl hugo wieslander, a swede, and karl ritter von halt, a german, were\n \n announced world record holders.\n \n \n \n the decathlon was added to the  olympic games in stockholm. after\n \n experience, the following order was chosen   run, long jump, shot put, high\n \n jump, and  run on the first day   hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin,\n \n and  run on the  day. the swedes also developed a set of scoring tables,\n \n based on the  olympic records. after the  stockholm games, the tables\n \n were updated to include many new olympic records.\n \n \n \n the  olympic decathlon has become legend because of the presence of jim\n \n thorpe. jim had a terrific  spring track season, winning as many as six\n \n events per meet. thorpe made the u.s. olympic team in four events  decathlon,\n \n pentathlon, high jump, and long jump. the russian czar donated a viking ship as\n \n a prize for the decathlon champion. thorpe won the decathlon by almost  \n points over his closet opponent, hugo wieslander of sweden. because of the\n \n unexpected large number of entries, the decathlon was held over  days. the\n \n first day they held the  run, long jump, and shot put. the second day\n \n consisted of the high jump,  run, discus, and  hurdles. the third and\n \n final day consisted of the pole vault, javelin, and  m run. thorpe   s  \n points converts to  points on the current tables, still a very respectable\n \n score three quarters of a century later. swedes  hugo wieslander, charles\n \n lomberg, and g  sta holm  r captured the next three spots.\n \n \n \n thorpe   s score was not beaten for another  years. in his absence, there was\n \n little decathlon activity for the remainder of the decade. only in sweden was\n \n the decathlon often contested. the swedes managed to stay neutral during world\n \n war i, which forced the cancellation of the games of berlin in  \n fascinatingly, decathlons were held as part of the far eastern games in  \n   and  \n \n \n the average good decathlete competes at most three or four times a year, the\n \n less talented even fewer. bill toomey   s nine great efforts back in  were\n \n very unusual. the decathlon is the least common olympic event.\n \n \n \n the decathlete does not have to be amazing in any event to be a champion in the\n \n  events. but he must range from adequate in his weak events to good or better\n \n in the other skills. because he must do well in the four runs and six field\n \n events, he has little opportunity to perfect any one event. his training is\n \n necessarily different as he strives to improve all techniques,  \n    \n      \n   \n    \n  \n  \n              \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n ',spam

   close(conin)\n \n    \n \n  \n  \n  you can simply use readlines() with the filename which open the \n \n  connection to a file itself. and i do not see why you want to read \n \n  the file here.

for(i in  \n      temp  readlines(file.path(dirdata, \"initial\", i))\n \n      temp  gsub(\'\"\', \"\'\", gsub(\"\'\", \"\'\'\", temp))\n \n      writelines(temp, con  file.path(dirdata, \"result\",

guide \n \n   \n  and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n  \n  \n   \n \n  \n  dear uwe,\n \n  \n  the code doesn\'t do what i want because i want to replace \' by \'\' \n \n  only when the character \' is embodied in \"......\"\n \n  so :\n \n   \" becomes \'\n \n   \".....\'......\" becomes \'......\'\'......\'\n \n    but \'.......\'  has to stay  \'.......\' and not \'\'......\'\'\n \n  \n  did i miss something ?\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n         \n \n  \n  \n  \n yes, gabor gave me the end of the solution. thank you uwe and gabor.\n \n for the people who are interested in the solution i will recapitulate \n \n below the differents steps.\n \n \n \n the objective was to replace in a lot of files single quotes in double \n \n quoted strings with single quoted strings containing double quotes in \n \n place of the single quotes. we have to allow for the fact that the \n \n pattern can be written on several lines in the files.\n \n \n \n let us list the steps to realize that :\n \n \n \n    read the lines of every file in a vector of strings (readlines)\n \n    transform this vector in a string with multiple lines \n \n  \n    use a regular expression on this string to do the replacement\n \n    go back to a vector of strings (strsplit) to have again the initial \n \n file altered\n \n    write the new file\n \n \n \n  \n                                 \n \n library(gsubfn)\n \n squote  \"\'\"  single quote.\n \n                this is a double quote, single quote, double quote\n \n dquote  \'\"\'  double quote\n \n                is a single quote, double quote, single quote\n \n \n \n f  function(x)  chartr(paste(squote, dquote), paste(dquote, squote), x)\n \n \n \n dirdata  getwd()   not necessary\n \n fichnames  list.files(file.path(dirdata,  \n \n  to select only the files with .prc extension for example\n \n for(i in  \n    lines  readlines(file.path(dirdata, \"\\\\initial\", i))\n \n    temp   f, paste(lines, collapse  \"\\n\"))\n \n    lines  unlist(strsplit(temp,\"\\n\"))  strsplit returns a list not a \n \n character vector\n \n    writelines(lines, con  file.path(dirdata, \"\\\\result\", i))\n \n  \n \n \n thank you very much again.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n content-type:   \n mime-version:  \n content-transfer-encoding:  \n content-disposition: inline\n \n \n \n  \n  mailing

extinct.\n \n \n \n reports of at least one male bird in arkansas in  and  were suggested in\n \n april  by a team led by the cornell laboratory of ornithology  fitzpatrick\n \n et al.,  . if confirmed, this would make the ivory billed woodpecker a\n \n lazarus species, a species that is rediscovered alive after being considered\n \n extinct for some time.\n \n \n \n in june  a  reward was offered for information leading to the\n \n discovery of an ivory billed woodpecker nest, roost or feeding site. ref   ref \n \n \n \n in late september  a team of ornithologists from auburn university and the\n \n university of windsor published a paper detailing suggestive evidence for the\n \n existence of ivory billed woodpeckers along the choctawhatchee river in\n \n northwest florida  hill et al.,  .\n \n \n \n this iconic bird, a symbol of lost southern bayous and swamps, is now a symbol\n \n of hope for conservationists throughout the world. efforts begun in the  \n preserved vital habitat for the species, allowing any remaining birds to\n \n survive. major land acquisition and restoration efforts are currently underway\n \n to protect the possible survival of this woodpecker.\n \n \n \n description the ivory billed woodpecker is the largest woodpecker species in the\n \n united states. the largest of all woodpeckers is the closely related imperial\n \n woodpecker  c. imperialis  of western mexico, another rare species which is very\n \n likely to be extinct. the ivory billed is  inches tall and weights  ounces.\n \n it has a  inch wing span.\n \n \n \n the bird is shiny blue black with white markings on its neck and back and\n \n extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper  and underwing. the\n \n underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line\n \n running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at\n \n the wingtip. in adults, the bill is ivory in color, chalky white in juveniles.\n \n ivory bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. the\n \n crest is black in juveniles and females. in males, the crest is black along its\n \n forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. the chin of an ivory \n \n bill is black. when perched with the wings folded, ivory bills of both sexes\n \n present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape.\n \n these characteristics distinguish it from the smaller and darker billed pileated\n \n woodpecker. the pileated normally is brownish black, smoky, or slaty black in\n \n color. it also has a white neck stripe but the back is normally black. pileated\n \n juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. pileateds normally have\n \n no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched normally show\n \n only a small patch of white on each side of the body near the edge of the wing.\n \n however, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been\n \n reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular\n \n patch on the lower back when perched. like all woodpeckers, the ivory bill has a\n \n strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard tipped, barbed tongue. among\n \n north american woodpeckers, the ivory bill is unique in having a bill whose tip\n \n is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel. the bird s\n \n drum is a single or double rap. four fairly distinct calls are reported in the\n \n literature and  were recorded in the  s. the most common, a kent or hant,\n \n sounds like a toy trumpet often repeated in series. when the bird is disturbed,\n \n the pitch of the kent note rises, it is repeated more frequently, and is often\n \n doubled. a conversational call, also recorded, is given between individuals at\n \n the nest, and has been described as yent yent yent.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n habitat and diet ivory billeds are known to prefer thick hardwood swamps and\n \n pine forests, with large amounts of dead and decaying trees. prior to the\n \n american civil war, much of the southern united states was covered in vast\n \n tracts of primeval hardwood forests that were suitable as habitat for the bird.\n \n at that time, the ivory billed woodpecker ranged from east texas to north\n \n carolina, and from southern illinois to florida and cuba. ref   ref  after the\n \n civil war, the timber industry deforested millions of acres in the south,\n \n leaving only sparse isolated tracts of suitable habitat.\n \n \n \n the ivory billed woodpecker feeds mainly on the larvae of wood boring beetles,\n \n but also eats seeds, fruit, and other insects. the bird uses its enormous white\n \n bill to hammer, wedge, and peel the bark off dead  \n    \n      \n   \n    \n  \n  \n              \n \n    \n \n \n ',spam

\n  sycoryctinae     fig wasps  are wasps of the family  agaonidae  which pollinate\n \n figs or are otherwise associated with figs.\n \n \n \n the family as presently defined is polyphyletic, including several unrelated\n \n lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs \n \n efforts are underway to resolve the matter, and remove a number of constituent\n \n groups to other families, particularly the pteromalidae and torymidae. thus, the\n \n number of genera in the family is in flux. probably only the agaoninae should be\n \n regarded as belonging to the agaonidae, whilst the sycoecinae, otitesellinae and\n \n sycoryctinae should be included in the pteromalidae. placement of the\n \n sycophaginae and epichrysomallinae remains uncertain.\n \n \n \n among the agaonidae, the female is a normal insect, while the males are mostly\n \n wingless. the males  only tasks are to mate with the females while still within\n \n the fig syconium and to chew a hole for the females to escape from the fig\n \n interior. this is the reverse of strepsiptera and the bagworm, where the male is\n \n a normal insect and the female never leaves the host.\n \n \n \n most figs have three kinds of flowers  male, short female, and long female.\n \n female fig wasps can reach the ovaries of short female flowers with their\n \n ovipositors, but not long female flowers. thus the short flowers grow wasps,\n \n whereas the long flowers become seeds. in figs of this sort, the crunchy bits in\n \n the fruit contain both seeds and wasps. however, there are several commercial\n \n and ornamental varieties of fig that are self fertile and do not require\n \n pollination  these varieties are not visited by fig wasps.\n \n \n \n pollinating fig wasps  agaoninae  are specific to specific figs. the common fig\n \n ficus carica is pollinated by  psenes.\n \n \n \n life cycle\n \n \n \n the life cycle of the fig wasp is closely intertwined with that of the fig tree\n \n they inhabit. the wasps that inhabit a particular tree can be loosely divided\n \n into two groups  pollinating and non pollinating. the pollinating variety forms\n \n a mutually beneficial symbiosis with the tree, whereas the non pollinating\n \n variety is parasitic. both life cycles, however, are very similar.\n \n \n \n         though the lives of individual species differ, a general fig wasp life\n \n         cycle is as follows. in the beginning of the cycle, a mature female\n \n         pollinator wasp lands on an unpollinated female fig flower. she deposits\n \n         her eggs in the flower by oviposition during which she often loses her\n \n         wings and most of her antennae. in depositing her eggs, the female also\n \n         deposits pollen she picked up from her original host fig. this\n \n         pollinates the fig and allows it to mature. after pollination, there are\n \n         several species of non pollinating wasps which deposit their eggs before\n \n         the figs harden. these wasps act as parasites to either the fig or the\n \n         pollinating wasps. as the fig develops, the wasp eggs hatch and develop\n \n         into larvae. upon hatching, the male   s first act is to mate with a\n \n         female. the males of many species lack wings and are unable to survive\n \n         outside the fig for a sustained period of time. after mating, a male\n \n         wasp begins to dig out of the fig, creating a tunnel for the females to\n \n         escape through.\n \n \n \n         once out of the fig, the male wasps quickly die. the females leave the\n \n         figs, picking up pollen as they do. they then fly to another tree of the\n \n         same species where they deposit their eggs and allow the cycle to begin\n \n         again.\n \n \n \n genera\n \n \n \n genera currently included in agaonidae according to the    internt.nhm.ac. \n \n uk jdsml perth chalcidoids

    piedmontese \n \n turin pronunce    n  is a major industrial city as well as a business and\n \n cultural centre in northern italy, capital of the piedmont region, located\n \n mainly on the west bank of the po river. the population of the city of turin is\n \n    census   its metropolitan area totals about  million\n \n inhabitants. the province is one of the largest in italy, with  km     \n sq. mi , and one of the most populous, with  inhabitants at the  \n census. turin is well known as the home of the shroud of turin, headquarters of\n \n fiat automobile manufacturer and host of the  winter olympics. it was the\n \n first capital of italy.\n \n \n \n history the name of turin comes from tau, a celtic word that means mountains.\n \n its italian name, torino, translates as  little bull   hence the coat of arms\n \n and the symbol of the city. the area was settled by the taurini in pre roman\n \n times.\n \n \n \n in the  century bc  probably  bc , the romans created a military camp\n \n  castra taurinorum , later dedicated to augustus  augusta taurinorum . the\n \n typical roman street grid can still be seen in the modern city. turin reached\n \n about  inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high walls.\n \n \n \n after the fall of the roman empire the city was conquered by the lombards, then\n \n the franks  in  the  di    countship of turin , also known as\n \n march , was founded, since  held by the family of the  then  counts of\n \n savoy. while the dignity of count was held by the bishop as conte di turino,  \n \n  and     it was ruled as a prince bishopric by the bishops. it was\n \n a lordship     under the marchese di monferrato, styled signore di\n \n torino   lord  \n \n \n \n at the end of the  century, when it was annexed to the duchy of savoy, the\n \n city already had  inhabitants. many of the gardens and palaces were built\n \n in the  century when the city was redesigned. the university was also\n \n founded during this period.\n \n \n \n emanuele filiberto  iron head  made turin the capital of the duchy of savoy in\n \n  piazza san carlo, via po and the royal palace  palazzo reale  were built\n \n in this period.\n \n \n \n in  the french besieged the city for  days without conquering it  battle\n \n of turin . after the subsequent treaty of utrecht, the kingdom of sardinia was\n \n annexed to the duchy of savoy and the architect filippo juvarra began a major\n \n redesign of the city. now the capital of a european kingdom, turin had about\n \n  inhabitants at the time.\n \n \n \n in the  century, after brief occupation by napoleon, the city began to\n \n actively pursue the unification of italy. in  the fr  jus tunnel was\n \n opened, making turin an important communication node. the city now had  \n inhabitants. the museo egizio, the mole antonelliana, the gran madre church and\n \n vittorio veneto square were built in this period.\n \n \n \n in  turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united italy. in  \n the capital was moved to florence.  since  the capital has been rome.  turin\n \n reacted to the loss of importance by beginning a rapid industrialisation  in\n \n  fiat was founded and lancia in  the universal exposition held in turin\n \n in  is often considered the pinnacle of art nouveau design, and the city\n \n hosted the exposition again in  by this time, turin had grown to  \n inhabitants.\n \n \n \n after world war i conflicts between workers and industrialists began. the first\n \n strikes took place and in  the lingotto factory was occupied.\n \n \n \n after world war ii turin was rapidly rebuilt and its industries greatly\n \n developed, which caused waves of immigration, largely from the southern regions\n \n of italy. the population reached  million in  and peaked at  million in\n \n  in the  the first industrial crisis hit the city and its population\n \n began to decline  and continues to, while the metropolitan area grows . the  \n population is

beyond its boundary, with extensive\n \n suburban areas on the western, northern and eastern sides, including thorpe st.\n \n andrew on the eastern side. the parliamentary seats cross over into adjacent\n \n local government districts. the population of the norwich travel to work area\n \n i.e. the area of norwich in which most people both live and work, is  and\n \n the  figure was   people live in the norwich city council\n \n area. norwich is the fourth most densely populated local authority district\n \n within the eastern region with  people per square kilometre   per\n \n square mile . history roman the romans had their regional capital at  \n icenor  on the river to the south which is near modern day caistor st\n \n edmund.\n \n \n \n early english norman conquest there are two suggested models of development for\n \n norwich. it is possible that three separate early anglo saxon settlements, one\n \n on the north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as\n \n they grew or that one anglo saxon settlement, on the north of the river, emerged\n \n in the mid  century after the abandonment of the previous three. the ancient\n \n city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in east anglia in  ad when\n \n it was raided and burnt by swein forkbeard the viking. mercian coins and shards\n \n of pottery from the rhineland dating to the  century suggest that long\n \n distance trade was happening long before this. between   ad norwich became\n \n fully established as a town due to the fact that it had its own mint. the word\n \n norvic appears on coins across europe minted during this period, in the reign of\n \n king athelstan. the vikings were a strong cultural influence in norwich for  \n \n  years at the end of the  century, setting up an anglo scandinavian\n \n district towards the north end of present day king street.\n \n \n \n at the time of the norman conquest the city was one of the largest in england.\n \n the domesday book states that it had approximately twenty five churches and a\n \n population of between five and ten thousand. it also records the site of an anglo \n \n saxon church in tombland, the site of the saxon market place and the later\n \n norman cathedral. norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the river\n \n wensum being a convenient export route to the sea. quern stones, and other\n \n artifacts, from scandinavia and the rhineland have been found during excavations\n \n in norwich city centre which date from the  century onwards.\n \n \n \n the main area of saxon settlement south of the wensum was destroyed by the\n \n construction of the norman castle  see norwich castle  during the  the\n \n normans established a new focus of settlement around the castle and the area to\n \n the west of it  this became known as the  new  or  french  borough, centred on\n \n the norman s own market place which survives to the present day as the city s\n \n provision market.\n \n \n \n in  bishop herbert de losinga, then bishop of thetford, began construction\n \n of norwich cathedral. the chief building material for the cathedral was\n \n limestone, imported from caen in normandy. to  \n    \n      \n   \n    \n  \n  \n              \n \n  \n    \n \n \n ',spam

depicted by sir thomas more as a\n \n perfect social, legal, and political system. in a negative meaning it refers to\n \n a society that is unrealistic and impossible to realize. it has also been used\n \n to describe actual communities founded in attempts to create an ideal society.\n \n \n \n related terms     is a negative utopia  a totalitarian and\n \n repressive world. examples  george orwell s  eighty  \n aldous huxley s  new  alan moore s  for  margaret\n \n atwood s  handmaid s  and lois lowry s     eutopia  is a\n \n positive utopia.   outopia  derived from the greek  ou  for  no  and   topos \n \n for  place   a perfect place  a fictional, non realistic place.   heterotopia ,\n \n the  other place , with its real and imagined possibilities  a mix of  utopian \n \n escapism and turning virtual possibilities into reality      example \n \n cyberspace. samuel r. delany s novel  on  is subtitled an\n \n ambiguous heterotopia to highlight that it is not strictly utopian  though not\n \n dystopian . the novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of\n \n utopia.\n \n \n \n more   utopia  \n \n \n \n  for the  edition of thomas more s  st. thomas more depicts a\n \n  rationally organized society, through the narration of an explorer who\n \n  discovers it   raphael hythlodaeus.\n \n \n \n utopia is largely based on plato s   plato  it is a\n \n perfect version of republic wherein the beauties of society reign  eg  equalism\n \n and a general pacifist attitude , although its citizens are all ready to fight\n \n if need be. the evils of society, eg  poverty and misery, are all removed. it\n \n has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires\n \n mercenaries from among its war prone neighbors  these mercenaries were\n \n deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more war like\n \n populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful\n \n peoples . the society encourages tolerance of all religions, but not of atheism,\n \n since the people believe that a man must fear some god, else he shall act evilly\n \n and their society will weaken. some readers have chosen to accept this imaginary\n \n society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have\n \n postulated more intended nothing of the like. some maintain the position that\n \n more s utopia functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal\n \n more about england than about an idealistic society. this interpretation is\n \n bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent derivation from\n \n the greek for  no place  and  good place    utopia  is a compound of the\n \n syllable eu, meaning good, and topos, meaning place. but the homonymous prefix\n \n ou, with the meaning  no,  also resonates in the word  the perfectly  good\n \n place  is really  no place. \n \n \n \n types of utopia economic utopia these utopias are based on economics. most of\n \n them formed in response to the harsh economic conditions of the  century.\n \n particularly in the early nineteenth century, several utopian ideas arose, often\n \n in response to the social disruption created by the development of commercialism\n \n and capitalism. these are often grouped in a greater  utopian socialist \n \n movement, due to their shared characteristics  an egalitarian distribution of\n \n goods, frequently with the total abolition of money, and citizens only doing\n \n work which they enjoy and which is for the common good, leaving them with ample\n \n time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. one classic example of such a\n \n utopia was edward bellamy s   another socialist utopia is\n \n william morris   from  written partially in response to the top \n \n down  bureaucratic  nature of bellamy s utopia, which morris criticized.\n \n however, as the socialist movement developed it moved away from utopianism  marx\n \n in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialisms he described as\n \n utopian.  for more information see the history of socialism article. \n \n \n \n utopias have also been imagined by the opposite side of the political spectrum.\n \n for example, robert a. heinlein s  moon is a harsh  portrays an\n \n individualistic and libertarian utopia. capitalist utopias of this sort are\n \n generally based on perfect market economies, in which there is no market\n \n failure mdash or the issue of market failure is never addressed, any more than\n \n socialist utopias address the issue of planning failures. also consider eric\n \n frank russell s book  great     whose last section details\n \n an economic and social utopia. this forms the first mention of the idea of local\n \n exchange trading systems  lets .\n \n \n \n political and historical utopia political utopias are ones in which the\n \n government establishes a society that is striving toward perfection. with that\n \n said, many such governments tend to be harsh in its execution of laws and allow\n \n little individualism if it conflicts with its primary goals. many strive for a\n \n controlled society where the state or government replaces religious and family\n \n values  and loyalties for that matter .\n \n \n \n a global utopia of world peace is often seen as one of the

historical war leader ambrosius\n \n aurelianus. the former had nothing to do with arthur and flourished after the\n \n arthurian period. supposedly a bard who went mad after witnessing the horrors of\n \n war, he was said to have fled civilization to become a wildman of the woods in\n \n the late  century. geoffrey had this individual in mind when he wrote his\n \n earliest surviving work, the prophetiae merlini  prophecies of merlin , which he\n \n claimed were the actual words of the legendary madman. medievalist gaston paris\n \n suggested he altered the name to  merlinus  rather than the standard\n \n romanization  merdinus  to avoid a resemblance to the obscene french word merde,\n \n meaning  shit .\n \n \n \n geoffrey s prophetiae do not reveal much about merlin s background. when he\n \n included the prophet in his next work, historia regum britanniae, he\n \n supplemented the characterization with stories about aurelius ambrosius, taken\n \n from nennius    according to nennius, ambrosius was\n \n discovered when the british king vortigern was trying to erect a tower. the\n \n tower always collapsed before completion, and his wise men told him the only\n \n solution was to sprinkle the foundation with the blood of a  child born without\n \n a father . ambrosius was rumored to be such a child, but when brought before the\n \n king, he revealed the real reason for the tower s collapse  below the foundation\n \n was a lake containing two dragons who destroyed the tower by fighting.\n \n \n \n geoffrey retells this story in historia regum britanniae with some\n \n embellishments, and gives the fatherless child the name of the prophetic bard,\n \n merlin. he keeps this new figure separate from aurelius ambrosius, and to\n \n disguise his changing of nennius, he simply and baldly states that ambrosius was\n \n another name for merlin. he goes on to add new episodes that tie merlin into the\n \n story of king arthur and his predecessors.\n \n \n \n geoffrey dealt with merlin again in his third work, vita merlini. he based the\n \n vita on stories of the original  century myrddin. though set long after his\n \n timeframe for the life of  merlin ambrosius , he tries to assert the characters\n \n are the same with references to king arthur and his death as told in the\n \n historia regum britanniae.\n \n \n \n merlinus caledonensis myrddin wyllt\n \n \n \n the earliest  pre  century  welsh poems concerning the myrddin legend\n \n present him as a madman living a wretched existence in the caledonian forest,\n \n ruminating on his former existence and the disaster that brought him low  the\n \n death of his lord gwenddoleu, whom he served as bard. the allusions in these\n \n poems serve to sketch out the events of the battle of arfderydd, where riderch\n \n hael, king of alt clut  strathclyde  slaughtered the forces of gwenddoleu, and\n \n myrddin went mad watching this defeat. the   date this battle\n \n to ad  and name gwenddoleu s adversaries as the sons of eliffer, presumably\n \n gwrgi and peredur.\n \n \n \n a version of this legend is preserved in a late  century manuscript, in a\n \n story called lailoken and kentigern. in this narrative, saint kentigern meets in\n \n a deserted place with a naked, hairy madman who is called lailoken, although\n \n said by some to be called merlynum or  merlin , who declares that he has been\n \n condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts. he added that he had\n \n been the cause for the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought\n \n  on the plain between liddel and carwannok.  having told his story, the madman\n \n lept up and fled from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness. he\n \n appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking kentigern for\n \n the sacrament, prophesying that he was about to die a triple death. after some\n \n hesitation, the saint granted the madman s wish, and later that day the\n \n shepherds of king meldred captured him, beat him with clubs, then cast him into\n \n the river tweed where his body was pierced by a stake, thus fulfilling his\n \n prophecy.\n \n \n \n welsh literature has many examples of a prophetic literature, predicting the\n \n military victory of all of the celtic peoples of great britain who will join\n \n together and drive the english      \n

parulidae genus    species    s. aurocapillus  binomial   seiurus\n \n  aurocapillus     linnaeus,  \n \n    the  ovenbird , seiurus aurocapillus, is a small songbird of the new world\n \n warbler family.\n \n \n \n ovenbirds are  cm long and weigh  g. they have white underparts streaked\n \n with black, and olive brown upperparts. they have a white eye ring, pinkish legs\n \n and a thin pointed bill. they have an orange line on the top of the crown\n \n bordered on each side with dark brown.\n \n \n \n their breeding habitat is mature deciduous and mixed forests, especially sites\n \n with less undergrowth, across canada and the eastern united states. the nest,\n \n the  oven , is a domed structure placed on the ground, woven from vegetation and\n \n with a side entrance. both parents feed the young birds.\n \n \n \n ovenbirds migrate to the southeastern united states, the west indies,and from\n \n mexico to northern south america.\n \n \n \n this bird seems just capable of crossing the atlantic, since there have been a\n \n handful of records in norway, ireland and great britain, but half of the six\n \n finds were of dead birds. a live ovenbird on st mary s, isles of scilly in\n \n october  had to be taken into care.\n \n \n \n they forage on the ground in dead leaves, sometimes hovering or catching insects\n \n in flight. this bird frequently tilts its tail up while walking. these birds\n \n mainly eat insects, spiders and snails, also seeds in winter.\n \n \n \n the    www.mbr pwrc.usgs.gov id framlst song   of the\n \n ovenbird is a loud teacher teacher

\n \n         when an investor is considering whether to buy, sell,\n \n         or hold a small cap company, often strong indicator of\n \n         the company’s viability in the marketplace is revenue\n \n         growth.  and while it’s not the only yardstick in\n \n         determining if a company is the next big winner, it may\n \n         well be the best means of validating the company’s\n \n         business plan.\n \n \n \n         this is even more dramatic for technology-based\n \n         companies, where market acceptance is largely measured\n \n         in dollars.  most investors lack the personal acumen to\n \n         evaluate a tech company’s core technology or\n \n         profitability.  a more ‘macro’ view suggests that\n \n         reports of profitability imply broader acceptance and\n \n         implied endorsement of the company’s efforts.\n \n \n \n         along these lines, txp corporation (otcbb:txpo), an\n \n         original design manufacturer (odm) for the\n \n         telecommunications industry, just announced financial\n \n         results for its  quarter and twelve months ended\n \n         december    txpo’s core

txp\n \n         corporation (otc bb:txpo.ob - news), an original design\n \n         manufacturer (odm) for the telecommunications industry,\n \n         today announced financial results for the three and\n \n         twelve months ended december   the company also\n \n         announced that it completed a private placement for\n \n         gross proceeds of  million to accelerate its ont\n \n         strategy.\n \n \n \n         michael c. shores, president and chief executive\n \n         officer of txp, commented, \"we are extremely pleased\n \n         with the rapid progress of our new optical network\n \n         terminal (ont) business, which we formed after hiring\n \n         the former siemens ont development team in late  \n         the integration has gone seamlessly and we have begun\n \n         commercialization of the technology. we recently\n \n         announced shipments for our first broadband passive\n \n         optical network (bpon) ont units to a major original\n \n         equipment manufacturer (oem) and a tier i carrier, both\n \n         of which represent major milestones for the company. we\n \n         also entered into a reseller agreement with a major\n \n         communications technology and infrastructure provider\n \n         that has begun distributing txp\'s bpon ont units to its\n \n         customers.\"\n \n \n \n         \"as we had anticipated, the major systems vendors and\n \n         carriers are beginning to explore oem sourcing for more\n \n         cost-effective, time-sensitive ont solutions that are\n \n         interoperable across a wide range of networks. we have\n \n         now demonstrated interoperability with three leading\n \n         optical line terminal (olt) oems and are moving to\n \n         demonstrate interoperability across all major\n \n         platforms. moreover, we believe our pre-manufacturing\n \n         services model and quick-turn capabilities enable us to\n \n         bring products to market faster and more cost\n \n         effectively than traditional providers. these combined\n \n         capabilities position txp to become a leading provider\n \n         of onts to support the accelerated roll-out of\n \n         \'fiber-to-home\' services nationwide.\"\n \n \n \n         mr. shores continued, \"our core prototyping and\n \n         retrofit businesses continue to generate very strong\n \n         top-line growth, as evidenced by a  increase in\n \n         company-wide revenue over the fourth quarter last year.\n \n         following the formation of our ont business, we\n \n         absorbed additional overhead; however, we believe it\n \n         was well worth the investment. our ont business\n \n         contains mostly fixed costs with a highly leverageable\n \n         infrastructure and sufficient capacity to support our\n \n         needs for the foreseeable future. as our ont business\n \n         continues to grow and we begin to cover the additional\n \n         fixed costs, we expect the division will become a major\n \n         contributor to our overall profitability. in addition\n \n         to our ont business, we expect  will also represent\n \n         our best year ever for both the prototyping and\n \n         retrofit divisions.\"\n \n \n \n         on march   txp completed a private placement\n \n         with cornell capital partners, for gross proceeds of\n \n         approximately  million. the company issued a\n \n         convertible note, which bears a  coupon and is\n \n         convertible into approximately  million shares of\n \n         txp common stock at a fixed rate of  per common\n \n         share. the private placement included five-year\n \n         warrants to purchase approximately  million shares\n \n         of common stock, consisting of: series a warrants to\n \n         purchase  million shares at  per share; series\n \n         b warrants to purchase  million shares at  per\n \n         share; series c warrants to purchase  shares at\n \n          per share; and series d warrants to purchase\n \n          shares at  per share. the proceeds of the\n \n         private placement will be used to accelerate the\n \n         company\'s ont business strategy.\n \n \n \n         mr. shores continued, \"we are extremely pleased with\n \n         the terms of our latest convertible note financing,\n \n         which was at a premium to the current market and\n \n         contains a fixed conversion price of  per share. in\n \n         connection with the financing, the remaining  \n         of  convertible notes issued to cornell capital\n \n         in august  was converted into common stock, which\n \n         significantly enhances our capital structure and\n \n         reduces potential dilution. after evaluating numerous\n \n         funding sources, we decided to partner with cornell\n \n         capital for our latest financing, as the

and txp iphotonics\n \n \n \n              to better understand the iphotonics business\n \n              opportunity it is important to understand\n \n              today’s competition between catv companies\n \n              and ilecs. the coax cable infrastructure of\n \n              catv’s has always had far greater bandwidth\n \n              carrying capacity than the copper wire\n \n              infrastructure of an ilec.  but only recently\n \n              have catvs started taking advantage of their\n \n              bandwidth capabilities to steal residential\n \n              and some business customers from ilecs. the\n \n              only way ilecs can compete with catvs, and\n \n              maybe surpass them, is to put a fiber-based\n \n              service delivery infrastructure in place,\n \n              even if vdsl-over-copper provides significant\n \n              improvements. whether it be ftth (fiber to\n \n              the home) or fttc (fiber to the curb), the\n \n              “ultimate” solution means deploying fiber out\n \n              to, or much closer to, customers. ultimately,\n \n              txp believes the catv’s will be forced into\n \n              doing the same thing.\n \n \n \n              in several respects, ftth initiatives are a\n \n              reprise of the adsl infrastructure upgrades\n \n              which began in the  and have\n \n              succeeded in delivering true “broadband”\n \n              services to nearly  of all homes in the\n \n              u.s. and approximately  of homes globally.\n \n              adsl aims to deliver high-speed data services\n \n              and internet access.  ftth delivers voice,\n \n              data, and video services. adsl (and the\n \n              successor technology vdsl) is utilized to\n \n              extract much higher bandwidth delivery\n \n              capability from the existing copper-based\n \n              local loop network.  pon (passive optical\n \n              network) is the ftth technology that ilecs\n \n              have broadly chosen to deliver much higher\n \n              bandwidth.  these bandwidths are larger than\n \n              their archrival competitors, the catv\n \n              companies.  an ont is the device which is\n \n              located at the individual customer premise to\n \n              receive pon-delivered services.  where adsl\n \n              service rollouts had the benefit of\n \n              already-deployed copper wire loops to all\n \n              customers, pon requires the ilec to install,\n \n              at considerable cost, fiber cables to each\n \n              customer premise. think: movies-on-demand\n \n \n \n                           \n \n \n

\n \n i\'m fairly sure the dataset described below would work with lme() -- but it\'d be great if anybody can confirm that after i describe the dataset below) \n \n \n \n the study involves measuring the effect of a drug on blood pressure. there were  patients in all and  replicate measures per patient of their blood pressure on one week (one measure per day). two weeks later, a drug was introduced to  randomly selected patients in such a way that i had equal representation of the  age groups among the two treatment groups. then, another two weeks later,  replicate measures per patient (per day) of blood pressure was retaken.  so each patient had  total measures whether they were in the treatment group or in the control group  reads  in the baseline-week and another  reads  in the post-treatment week).  \n \n \n \n so, \n \n background:  patients \n \n response measure: blood pressure \n \n fixed factor:  age groups \n \n fixed factor: drug vs. nodrug \n \n random factor: day of the read (i.e.  replicate reads  at the baseline time, and  replicate reads  after the drug has had time to take effect) \n \n random factor: subjects  \n \n \n \n patient    agegroup

having the most trouble with is the repeated reads  through  in the  treatment weeks.  i\'m fairly sure this is a random variable -- their order or identify  in pre-treatment week has no relation to  in the post-treatment week, etc).  by placing read as a random variable, am i covering myself there?\n \n if i execute:\n \n \n \n  summary(lme(bp ~ group, random  ~   patient, data  bloodpress,  \n \n \n i get a result, but i\'m not sure it\'s correct -- do i need to tell the model about the read factor  in  weeks)?  \n \n \n \n i\'m really trying to set the right form of the lme() function call to decide \n \n  if there is a statistical difference between the  groups and,\n \n  if one takes into account agegroup, is there a statistical difference between  groups, and finally\n \n  if i don\'t see a statistical difference, can someone recommend an r function that might solve the supplemental question, \"given the noise in day-to-day blood pressure reads, and given that i wanted to have enough statistical power to observe a say, a  benefit in blood pressure, how many additional reads or patients i would need.\"\n \n \n \n basically, is lme() the proper function, and can someone offer any pointers on what my call to this function should look like to make the above to determinations?\n \n \n \n thanks!\n \n -scott\n \n \n \n  \n  mailing list\n \n  \n please do read the

trade\n \n bush administration provides partial korea fta to congress\n \n  \n \n \n date: april   \n \n \n the bush administration mid-week provided congress parts of the text for\n \n the\n \n newly concluded free trade agreement with korea but has not committed to\n \n a\n \n deadline of when it will provide the full text, according to\n \n congressional\n \n aides.\n \n \n \n the office of the u.s. trade representative submitted \"more than half\"\n \n of\n \n the fta text to congress and cleared industry and agriculture advisors\n \n who\n \n will have to assess the agreement for a formal report to congress within\n \n a\n \n month, assistant u.s. trade representative for japan, korea and apec\n \n wendy\n \n cutler said on april  \n \n \n but a critic of the fta said that the text provided does not cover many\n \n of\n \n the controversial issues that were settled in the last round of\n \n negotiations\n \n that ended on april  \n \n \n deputy u.s. trade representative karan bhatia said on april  the u.s.\n \n and\n \n korea are in the process of \"writing up\" the agreement after their final\n \n marathon negotiating session, but he emphasized that was not unusual.\n \n \"there\n \n is always additional legal drafting that needs to occur, so we\'ll be\n \n doing\n \n that,\" he said.\n \n \n \n unresolved is the issue of which standards the fta should contain with\n \n respect to labor and the environment. ustr says the text now reflects\n \n the\n \n obligation for each signatory to enforce its own laws, a standard that\n \n house\n \n democrats have criticized as insufficient and are seeking to strengthen\n \n in\n \n discussions with the administration for a new fta template.\n \n \n \n as a result of these on-going efforts, there \"may be a need\" to revisit\n \n the\n \n labor and environment issues, bhatia said. he signaled that korea was\n \n not\n \n happy with the fact that there was no final u.s. government position on\n \n the\n \n labor and environment provisions.  it turns out that there are\n \n changes\n \n that would need to be made on labor and environment in order to obtain\n \n congressional passage, . . . we\'ll make a decision jointly as to whether\n \n those changes would be acceptable to korea,\" he said.\n \n \n \n bhatia emphasized that korea is a \"different case\" in terms of labor\n \n rights\n \n compared to other countries with which the u.s. has concluded ftas\n \n because\n \n it has strong labor rights and strong unions.\n \n \n \n ustr has taken the position that an fta can still be changed over the\n \n next\n \n  days up to the deadline when u.s. industry advisors have to complete\n \n their assessment of the deal, according to a ustr spokesman.\n \n \n \n the bush administration on april  formally notified congress of its\n \n intent\n \n to sign the fta just \"minutes before the expiration of the  \n deadline\" of midnight, and this was possible because congress agreed to\n \n have\n \n someone available to formally receive the letter of notification at that\n \n time, the spokesman said.\n \n \n \n congress was out of session at that time, but the fast-track law does\n \n not\n \n contain a requirement that congress be in session to receive the formal\n \n notification of an administration\'s intent to sign a trade agreement,\n \n according to a senate aide. therefore, the administration met the\n \n statutory\n \n requirements of the fast-track law, he said. separately, a ustr\n \n spokesman\n \n said the deadline for the submission of the notification was determined\n \n after consultations with congress and an internal assessment by ustr\n \n lawyers.\n \n \n \n u.s. negotiators had initially told their korean counterparts that the\n \n deadline was late march  in washington, d.c.\n \n \n \n the fast-track law provides that a trade agreement can be signed  days\n \n after the administration formally notifies to congress its intent to do\n \n so.\n \n notifying the korea fta on april  means it can be signed before fast\n \n track\n \n expires on july  this year. once a trade agreement is signed, it can be\n \n considered under fast track with an up-or-down vote even after the law\n \n itself has expired.\n \n \n \n bhatia also said the korea fta will pressure other asian economies to\n \n negotiate ftas with the u.s. \"to be honest with you, there is a\n \n possibility\n \n that a successful korea-u.s. fta will be the stepping stone to a wave of\n \n liberalization in east asia.\"\n \n \n \n he also said the fta with korea contains stronger commitments than any\n \n other\n \n fta negotiated by the u.s. in such areas of financial services,\n \n transparency\n \n and competition.\n \n \n \n \n \n inside us trade\n \n bhatia cool to auto changes in korea fta, takes on critics\n \n  \n \n \n date: april   \n \n \n deputy u.s. trade representative karan bhatia this week ruled out\n \n changes to\n \n the auto provisions of the newly negotiated u.s.-korea free trade\n \n agreement\n \n as demanded by house energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell\n \n (d-mi) and house ways and means trade subcommittee chairman sander levin\n \n (d-mi).\n \n \n \n \"with respect to changes during the  period to the auto\n \n provisions, i\n \n don\'t anticipate such changes,\" bhatia said in an april  press\n \n conference.\n \n he insisted that the fta automotive provisions took \"carefully into\n \n consideration the views expressed by industry and also by members of\n \n congress\" and will enable american manufacturers to access the korean\n \n market.\n \n \n \n both levin and dingell charged in their respective public statements\n \n that\n \n the fta negotiators disregarded the proposal from members of congress\n \n aimed\n \n at correcting the automotive trade imbalance between korea and the u.s.\n \n instead, dingell said, the agreement has created new opportunities for\n \n korean carmakers and not for the u.s. industry.\n \n \n \n both levin and dingell said they would vote no on the agreement in its\n \n current form. separately, sen. debbie stabenow (d-mi) strongly\n \n criticized\n \n the korea fta and vowed to defeat it at all costs. \"the automobile\n \n industry\n \n built the middle class in this country, and by supporting this agreement\n \n the\n \n administration has turned its back on our working families,\" she said in\n \n an\n \n april  statement.\n \n \n \n similarly, ford motor company and chrysler group as well as the\n \n automotive\n \n trade policy council, which represents all three u.s. automakers on\n \n trade\n \n issues, expressed disappointment over the outcome of the negotiations\n \n but\n \n stopped short of strong criticism. general motors, which has operations\n \n in\n \n korea through its partner company, gm-daewoo, failed to issue a\n \n statement.\n \n \n \n ford motor company\'s vice president of international governmental\n \n affairs\n \n called on congress to reject the fta in its \"current form\" in an april  \n statement. chrysler group in an april  statement also pledged to oppose\n \n the\n \n agreement \"as we currently understand it.\" the chrysler statement\n \n pointed\n \n out the company has supported every past fta the u.s. government has\n \n negotiated.\n \n \n \n however, one private-sector source speculated that the auto companies,\n \n though displeased with the outcome of the negotiations, might not lobby\n \n hard\n \n against the ftas, given the other major issues for which they may need\n \n administration cooperation. this includes fuel standards, developing an\n \n alternative fuel infrastructure and legacy costs, he said.\n \n \n \n this may mean that the uaw will emerge as the only strong force in\n \n lobbying\n \n against the korea fta, according to this source. in its statement, the\n \n uaw\n \n urged congress to reject the deal, which it said is one-sided and\n \n threatens\n \n \"tens of thousands of u.s. auto jobs.\"\n \n \n \n bhatia downplayed this criticism and insisted that the auto industry is\n \n better off with this agreement than without it because the fta provides\n \n for\n \n the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers in the korean market.\n \n \"without this agreement, there is no such assurance,\" he said. \"i would\n \n suggest that   very much would be better off with the\n \n agreement.\"\n \n \n \n the fta would phase out the u.s. tariff for certain cars immediately and\n \n the\n \n  percent truck tariff over  years without establishing any specific\n \n market access targets, according to u.s. officials. some sources\n \n speculated\n \n that the u.s. auto industry is most unhappy with the end of the truck\n \n tariff, which the congressional automotive proposal sought to exclude\n \n from\n \n the fta.\n \n \n \n the  percent u.s. auto tariff will be immediately be eliminated for\n \n cars\n \n with engine sizes up to  ccs, bhatia said on april  one\n \n private-sector source said that this covers the bulk of the cars that\n \n korea\n \n exports to the united states. this would exclude luxury cars or sports\n \n utility vehicles, he said.\n \n \n \n in addition, the fta would phase out korea\'s  percent tariff on u.s.\n \n cars\n \n immediately upon entry into force, bhatia said.\n \n \n \n under the agreement, korea agreed to restructure its engine displacement\n \n tax, which the u.s. had sought to eliminate as a non-tariff barrier, he\n \n said. it will revamp its structure in the first three years after\n \n implementation to \"require the leveling of the taxes\" so that cars of\n \n the\n \n size the u.s. makes  on a level playing field with somewhere\n \n between  and  percent of the domestic market.\"\n \n \n \n assistant ustr for japan, korea and apec wendy cutler said korea\'s\n \n special\n \n consumption tax would be cut to  percent from its current  percent\n \n within\n \n three years after implementation.\n \n \n \n cutler said korea also agreed to reduce the number of categories of cars\n \n subject to the tax. by year three of the fta, she said, about  percent\n \n of\n \n korean and imported cars will be in a common category for engines  \n ccs\n \n and above, while cars  ccs and below will be in a second category.\n \n \n \n in addition, korea has agreed to a bilateral working group that would\n \n keep\n \n abreast of government initiatives on standards development to prevent\n \n future\n \n trade problems. bhatia said that the group is meant to promote\n \n coordination\n \n between the u.s. and korea on regulatory issues.\n \n \n \n the bilateral working group features a built-in transparency requirement\n \n \"to\n \n ensure that there is not coordination  the korean government and\n \n korean  that we\'re not aware of with respect to technical\n \n standards,\" bhatia said. \"the koreans can bet that any time they share\n \n written information with any stakeholder outside of their government\n \n concerning a regulation or a technical standard, they have to provide\n \n that\n \n same information to the u.s.-korea bilateral working group on\n \n automotive.\"\n \n \n \n the fta also contains an expedited dispute settlement process for autos\n \n that\n \n would last six months between the formal launch of a dispute and the\n \n panel\n \n decision, bhatia announced. a signatory that brings a successful case\n \n would\n \n have the right to snap its tariffs back to most-favored nation levels,\n \n he\n \n said. \"we think that is a very powerful incentive not to violate any of\n \n the\n \n fta commitments in this area, and the fact that reimposition could\n \n happen\n \n immediately upon the finding by the panel only enhances that deterrent\n \n effect,\" bhatia said. \"the dispute settlement provision i think very\n \n closely\n \n parallels the request that congress put forth to us.\"\n \n \n \n bhatia also said the fta addresses a set of emissions regulations to\n \n facilitate u.s. automotive exports to korea. specifically, he said that\n \n under the fta, some u.s. cars can enter korea if they follow a\n \n california\n \n emissions standard, rather than a harder-to-meet korean standard. --\n \n luke\n \n engan\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n ip-health mailing list\n \n  \n  \n \n \n ',ham

laboratories\n \n  abbott park road\n \n abbott park, il  \n \n \n dear miles white,\n \n \n \n we, the undersigned, are disappointed and outraged by abbott’s\n \n decision to stop marketing new medicines in thailand and to withdraw\n \n all applications to register medicines in the country.\n \n \n \n abbott has decided to retreat from the thai market in retaliation to\n \n thailand’s lawful decision to issue compulsory licenses for three\n \n medicines, including for two antiretrovirals: efavirenz and lopinavir\n \n  (kaletra). these compulsory licenses will achieve\n \n reductions in costs and will increase access to critically important\n \n medicines in thailand, something protracted negotiations between the\n \n thai government and abbott unfortunately did not achieve.\n \n \n \n abbott’s decision to deny medicines to thai patients is an\n \n inappropriate response to the lawful actions of a country addressing\n \n its urgent public health needs in a manner that is completely\n \n consistent with its international obligations according to the world\n \n trade organization’s agreement on trade related aspects of\n \n intellectual property rights (trips), and it is also consistent with\n \n thai national law.\n \n \n \n furthermore, you are clearly attempting to set a precedent and send a\n \n message to other developing countries that they, too, will be\n \n punished in this fashion should they decide to use their lawful right\n \n to issue compulsory licenses to increase access to medicines. this is\n \n unacceptable.\n \n \n \n importantly, your decision identifies you as an outlier among\n \n pharmaceutical companies: at this point in time time we are aware of\n \n no other pharmaceutical company that has ever responded as you have\n \n in reaction to the issuance of compulsory licenses.\n \n \n \n if abbott believed that thailand’s actions were not consistent with\n \n their trips commitments then there are legal avenues by which to\n \n contest this. however, by withdrawing registrations for essential\n \n medicines from the thai market, such as heat-stable lopinavir\n \n  essential antiretroviral adapted for hot climates and\n \n

------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n -\n \n national review congress daily\n \n by martin vaughan\n \n april   \n \n \n           drug companies look to head off house  deal\n \n \n \n      pharmaceutical companies are working to head off a deal between\n \n house democrats and the bush administration that would weaken\n \n intellectual property protections that affect drug sales overseas.\n \n \n \n      the issue of intellectual property rights and access to medicines\n \n is one of six broad areas democrats are seeking to renegotiate in\n \n agreements with peru and colombia, and create a new standard for other\n \n trade agreements going forward.\n \n \n \n      the call by house ways and means chairman rangel to alter ipr\n \n provisions has already generated some pushback from within the\n \n democratic caucus, in particular from new democrats concerned that an\n \n agreement not undercut the drug industry\'s ability to bring innovative\n \n drugs to the market.\n \n \n \n      in separate interviews, reps. adam smith, d-wash., and james moran,\n \n \n \n d-va., identified the issue of access to medicines as one part of the\n \n democratic proposal that might need to be fine-tuned.\n \n \n \n      brand-name pharmaceutical firms met thursday with staff for new\n \n democrats and lodged their concerns with the rangel agenda, according to\n \n \n \n a senior new democrat staffer.\n \n \n \n      the staffer stressed that new democrats support the broad outline\n \n that rangel offered this week, while details still have to be\n \n negotiated.\n \n \n \n      rangel and ways and means trade subcommittee chairman sander levin,\n \n \n \n d-mich., laid out their proposal tuesday to the house democratic caucus,\n \n \n \n which they hoped would serve as a blueprint for passing free trade deals\n \n \n \n and extending presidential trade negotiating authority.\n \n \n \n      according to a statement from new democrats, \"the leadership of the\n \n \n \n new democrat coalition supports the trade principles outlined by\n \n chairman rangel and applauds his effort to negotiate a bipartisan\n \n compromise that would allow forward-thinking trade policies to move\n \n ahead.\"\n \n \n \n      but the inclusion of language opposed by the pharmaceutical\n \n industry is likely to have a heavier impact on the republican side,\n \n where votes for any eventual trade deals will be every bit as crucial as\n \n \n \n democratic votes.\n \n \n \n      industry lobbyists also raised the issue of intellectual property\n \n protections at a meeting hosted by house minority whip blunt and chief\n \n deputy minority whip eric cantor, r-va., according to a source who\n \n attended the meeting.\n \n \n \n      the pharmaceutical issue is not as high-profile as democratic\n \n demands on labor, and might ultimately be easier to solve, according to\n \n sources close to discussions.\n \n \n \n      the labor issue remains intractable because democrats have not\n \n altered their demand that trade agreements obligate all parties to abide\n \n \n \n by core international labor organization standards, and neither the bush\n \n \n \n administration nor republicans are likely to agree to any plan that\n \n would subject the united states to legal challenge over whether its\n \n labor laws conform to the ilo.\n \n \n \n      \"without a safe harbor for u.s. labor law, it\'s a non-starter,\"\n \n rep. kevin brady, r-texas, a member of the ways and means panel, said\n \n thursday.\n \n \n \n      the intellectual property provisions in question affect how quickly\n \n \n \n generic drug-makers are able to bring generic versions of patented drugs\n \n \n \n to market in developing countries.\n \n \n \n      according to sources familiar with the proposals, which are not yet\n \n \n \n public, house democrats are seeking more flexibility in a requirement\n \n that protects clinical test data for brand-named drugs from being used\n \n to bring generic drugs to market for five years after the patented drug\n \n has been registered in a country.\n \n \n \n      critics have charged that the five-year requirement effectively\n \n could delay approval of generics past patent expiration.\n \n \n \n      brand-name manufacturers typically will register a new drug in the\n \n united states and european union first, which starts a period of test\n \n data exclusivity in those markets. registration in smaller markets might\n \n \n \n not come for months or years.\n \n \n \n      that sets up a situation where generic drugs are already available\n \n in the united states, but not in poorer countries because the five-year\n \n data exclusivity provision has not yet expired.\n \n \n \n      democrats are proposing that the five-year period of exclusivity\n \n for trading partners be allowed to run concurrently with the exclusivity\n \n \n \n period in the united states, so that generic availability in the other\n \n country is not delayed beyond the u.s. period.\n \n \n \n      that demand is significantly less than some house democrats and\n \n health activists would have asked, who have sought that any specific\n \n minimum period for data exclusivity be removed from trade agreements.\n \n \n \n      one industry observer said in some cases data protection is at\n \n least as important as patent protection, because patent infringements\n \n must be challenged in courts that might be corrupt or unsympathetic to\n \n the industry\'s arguments.\n \n \n \n      it is unclear how willing the bush administration might be to\n \n accept democratic terms in the area of medicines.\n \n \n \n      the office of the u.s. trade representative has criticized\n \n countries such as israel and chile, in its annual special  report on\n \n intellectual property, for domestic laws aimed at limiting drug\n \n companies\' flexibility to take advantage of data exclusivity\n \n protections.\n \n \n \n      but several sources in the business community said they doubted the\n \n \n \n administration would let the drug industry\'s concerns stand in the way\n \n of an agreement that will pave the way for large parts of its trade\n \n agenda to move forward.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n --\n \n mike palmedo\n \n

\n \n \n april   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n although the final text of the korea-us free trade agreement has not\n \n been released, it is evident from a careful reading of ustr\'s summary\n \n that many of its provisions will go far beyond the controversial\n \n restrictions on australia\'s pharmaceutical benefit scheme (pbs) included\n \n in annex  of the australia-us free trade agreement.  following the\n \n practice of terming provisions that go beyond the minimum requirement of\n \n trips as \"trips-plus,\" this paper coins a new phrase - \"annex  plus\" -\n \n for provisions in the korea agreement that go beyond annex  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n this is a first draft note including preliminary analysis.  i invite\n \n comments to   subsequent drafts will be posted to\n \n www.pijip.org   as new information is released.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  and drug formularies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  was the first section of an fta with the u.s. to attempt to\n \n restrict the operation of public pharmaceutical reimbursement schemes\n \n based on a drug formulary (referred to by the republic of korea as a\n \n \"positive list\" and by u.s. states as \"preferred drug lists.\")  the\n \n principle of a formulary is simple.  in order to ensure value for money\n \n and negotiate reasonable prices with drug companies, the payer must be\n \n able to say \"no\" to some extent to the drug company\'s offered terms of\n \n sale.  this is normally accomplished by requiring that higher priced\n \n drugs with equivalent therapeutic value compared to alternatives be\n \n subject to some form of prior authorization, subject to restrictions on\n \n subsidized use, or excluded from reimbursement entirely if the\n \n incremental therapeutic value is not considered sufficient to justify\n \n the price premium.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n the desire of companies to have their products reimbursed in the easiest\n \n possible manner provides an incentive for them to negotiate lower prices\n \n to the purchaser.  formularies can also be used to steer patients toward\n \n generic equivalents of or therapeutic substitutes for brand name\n \n products.  because of their effectiveness at promoting negotiation of\n \n lower prices, some version of a formulary for drug purchases is used by\n \n every substantial purchaser of drugs, including private insurance\n \n companies and corporations, u.s. and foreign governments, and nearly\n \n every state government medicaid program.  but the pharmaceutical\n \n industry is becoming increasingly successful at achieving limitations on\n \n this important and effective tool by public entities through the\n \n operation of binding trade rules.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  of the australia-u.s. fta was the result of intense\n \n pharmaceutical industry lobbying against one of the most effective drug\n \n formularies in the   the australian pbs scheme works by\n \n requiring drugs seeking listing on the formulary to be assessed based on\n \n evidence of the comparative effectiveness, including comparative cost\n \n effectiveness, against the therapy most likely to be replaced in\n \n practice.  combined with a reference pricing system, the pbs will only\n \n list a medicine at higher price than the comparator where it is able to\n \n demonstrate an incremental benefit.  where a new drug is deemed to offer\n \n equivalent benefits to patients, the system will not list the drug at a\n \n higher price irrespective of its patent status.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  did not mandate that australia provide equally simple access to\n \n every drug without price restraint, as the pharmaceutical industry\n \n wished.  it did, however, implement a number of procedures and normative\n \n principles that some argue could enable them to challenge listing\n \n decisions.  the annex included three main sections:\n \n \n \n  \"agreed principles,\" expressing commitments to recognize the value\n \n of \"innovative pharmaceuticals\";\n \n \n \n  transparency provision, mandating certain procedures, including\n \n written reasons and \"independent review process\" for listing\n \n recommendations; and\n \n \n \n  participation in a \"medicines working group\" to \"promote discussion\n \n and mutual understanding\" of the issues raised in the annex.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ustr\'s fact sheet on the korea-us agreement follows the same general\n \n pattern of annex  and therefore one can surmise what much of the\n \n language in the final text will be.  importantly, the fact sheet\n \n includes several key changes in wording and additions to annex  i.e.\n \n annex  provisions, that may further decrease the ability of korea\n \n to use its public drug formulary to negotiate lower prices.  these\n \n provisions are discussed in more detail below.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n title: pharmaceuticals and medical devices\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     pharmaceuticals and medical devices: a\n \n shared commitment on access to innovative medicines\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n analysis:  the first notable annex  provision in the korea-us is\n \n included in the title of the section.  where annex  was titled\n \n \"pharmaceuticals,\" the korea fact sheet labels the section\n \n \"pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\"  the inclusion of \"medical\n \n devices\" is new.  annex  only covered reimbursement programs for\n \n medicines, not medical devices.  the scope of the korea-us fta is thus\n \n likely to be much broader than annex  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n agreed principles\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     agreement on common principles on\n \n facilitating high-quality health care and continued improvements in\n \n public health for nationals.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n this provision appears similar to the principles included in the\n \n australia-us agreement.  it does not clearly include annex  \n provisions.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  included a set of \"agreed principles\" favorable to the branded\n \n drug industry, including commitments to \"the important role played by\n \n innovative pharmaceutical products,\" the need to promote \"access to\n \n innovative pharmaceuticals through transparent, expeditious and\n \n accountable procedures,\" and \"the need to recognize the value of\n \n innovative pharmaceuticals.\"  similar principles, focused on branded\n \n drugs, can be expected in the korea fta principles.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n much may lie in the definition of \"innovative pharmaceuticals\" if that\n \n term is used in the korea agreement.  the australians consider an\n \n \"innovative\" drug as one conferring a clinically important improvement\n \n in patient outcome.  the pharmaceutical industry tends to equate\n \n innovative with patented.  patented drugs do not necessarily have any\n \n additional clinical benefit - they are required by the patent system to\n \n be novel, not clinically  annex  did not define\n \n \"innovative pharmaceuticals.\"  it will be important to analyze the korea\n \n language for further detail in this area.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n access to innovative products\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     commitment to increase access to\n \n innovative products, including through insurance the fair, reasonable,\n \n and non-discriminatory treatment for pharmaceutical products and medical\n \n devices.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n this entire provision appears to be annex   nothing in annex  \n recorded a commitment to increase the use of \"innovative\" products.\n \n and, as mentioned earlier, nothing in annex  applied to \"devices.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n it is not clear what the final text language will do to \"increase access\n \n to innovative products.\"  the pharmaceutical industry has argued that\n \n public systems should reimburse every product for every registered\n \n indication.  such a principle would obliterate the effectiveness of a\n \n drug formulary since there would be no potential to refuse\n \n reimbursement.  the degree to which the korea-us fta will damage korea\'s\n \n negotiating power through its formulary is unknown at this point.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n transparency\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     commitments on transparency in the\n \n pricing and reimbursement process for pharmaceutical products and\n \n medical devices.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  included a provision on \" transparency\" applicable only where\n \n \"federal healthcare authorities operate or maintain procedures for\n \n listing new pharmaceuticals or indications for reimbursement purposes.\"\n \n for such programs, annex  required that the system ensure decisions\n \n within a specified period of time, disclose \"procedural\" rules and\n \n guidelines used to assess a proposed listing, afford opportunities to\n \n companies to provide comments, provide written reasons for listing\n \n decisions, and \"make available an independent review process\" for the\n \n decisions.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n the restriction of the application to \"federal\" level reimbursement\n \n programs is noticeably absent from the summary description of the korea\n \n fta.  if this absence is carried forward in the actual agreement text,\n \n it may be the most important annex  provision from the point of\n \n view of u.s. states.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n at least  u.s. states operate preferred drug price lists for medicaid\n \n and other programs.  under fta implementing legislation, the u.s.\n \n government maintains the authority to sue states to preempt programs and\n \n laws that do not comply with the   u.s. states have raised\n \n concerns with the indeterminacy of annex  as applied to medicaid\n \n   under medicaid, states play a large part in paying for\n \n and administering the drug benefit, but ultimately it is federal law\n \n that determines which drugs are covered for reimbursement and thus could\n \n be considered a \"federal\" program for annex  purposes.  if the korea\n \n agreement is not expressly limited to  level programs,\n \n it would more directly threaten the most effective tool that states now\n \n have in restraining medicine prices.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n improper inducements\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     agreement to adopt and maintain measures\n \n to prohibit improper inducements by pharmaceutical products and medical\n \n device manufacturers and to enforce such measures.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n it is not clear what this provision is indicating.  there is no similar\n \n provision in annex  nor was one negotiated during the fta process.\n \n it is annex  although to what effect it is difficult to\n \n ascertain.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n medicines and medical devices working group\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     agreement to establish a medicines and\n \n medical devices working group that will provide for continued dialogue\n \n between the united states and korea on emerging health care policy\n \n issues.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  provided for a \"medicines working group\" to \"promote discussion\n \n and mutual understanding of issues relating to this annex . . . ,\n \n including the importance of pharmaceutical research and development to\n \n continued health outcomes.\"  the extension of this mandate to \"medical\n \n devices\" is new, and therefore annex  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n independent review body\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n korea fact sheet language:     agreement by korea to establish and\n \n maintain an independent body that reviews recommendations or\n \n determinations regarding the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical\n \n products and medical devices.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n annex  provided for \"an independent review process,\" not a \"body.\"\n \n the distinction could be important.  australia has complied with annex\n \n  by establishing a review process within the health system with no\n \n authority to overturn the decision of the expert body in the pbs.  it\n \n can only report findings on matters in dispute back to the expert body\n \n which may then decide to reconsider a recommendation (but is not obliged\n \n to).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n the korea language mandating creation of an \"independent body\" may imply\n \n an obligation set up an additional panel of experts with authority to\n \n overturn the decision of the initial panel of experts that decides\n \n listing decisions.  this provision would be wasteful and may provide\n \n opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry to engage in complex and\n \n well-funded efforts to capture the attention and interests of the review\n \n \"body\" through repetitive proceedings.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n interestingly, the language in the fact sheet only applies to korea.\n \n annex  binds both countries.  it will therefore be interesting to\n \n watch for whether the agreement is in fact one-sided when the language\n \n is finally released.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

tema desde la  del cincuenta, \n \n           el  de la charla es el de brindar una serie de herramientas \n \n           que permitan ampliar en nuestra cultura la  de \n \n           los

artifacts? don?t ask \n \n by jeremy kahn\n \n washington\n \n \n \n the rumor swept through the aisles of the seventh regiment armory in new\n \n york as art dealers traded gossip with collectors: dina powell was going to\n \n china. \n \n \n \n normally a routine overseas trip by a government figure ? ms. powell is an\n \n assistant secretary of state ? would hardly warrant attention from experts\n \n on song dynasty ceramics or buddhist statuary. but in their minds, this time\n \n their very livelihoods were at stake. the fear was that ms. powell, who\n \n heads the state department?s bureau of educational and cultural affairs, was\n \n going to beijing to announce a sweeping ban on the import of chinese art and\n \n artifacts predating  the chinese requested the ban in  arguing\n \n that an insatiable american demand for such objects was spurring the looting\n \n of valuable archaeological sites in china. \n \n \n \n as it turned out, the rumor was false: the state department says that ms.\n \n powell is not planning a june visit, although it refuses to say when or how\n \n the united states will rule on the chinese request. but the panic sowed by\n \n the gossip, in the midst of new york?s annual asia week sales last month,\n \n suggests the high stakes riding on the american decision.\n \n \n \n at the center of the controversy is not a ranking official but an obscure\n \n state department advisory panel that has become the b?te noire of collectors\n \n of everything from roman vases to african statuary. the panel, the cultural\n \n property advisory committee, has been the focus of fierce battles between\n \n archaeologists, who say the art market fosters the looting of historic\n \n sites, and dealers, who say that broad import restrictions threaten\n \n collecting by private individuals and museums in the united states. \n \n \n \n congress established the committee in  to balance the interests of these\n \n adversaries, deterring pillage abroad while also protecting the legal\n \n antiquities trade. but critics claim that it now tilts heavily in favor of\n \n the archaeological lobby, even in cases when the foreign countries seeking\n \n import restrictions have not met the criteria set down by the law.\n \n \n \n ?i don?t think the committee has been fulfilling the intent of the original\n \n legislation,? said meredith palmer, a manhattan dealer in  art\n \n who worked on cultural patrimony issues at the state department in the  \n and helped establish the cultural property advisory committee, known as\n \n c.p.a.c. \n \n \n \n kate fitz gibbon, a dealer of asian art in santa fe, n.m., and a former\n \n member of the committee, said some members of it now seem to have a\n \n full-blown ?prejudice against collecting?: so much so, she argued in an\n \n e-mail message, that they seek to bend the law to ?meet a perceived need to\n \n end the trade.? \n \n \n \n just how did an entity intended as a grand compromise and welcomed by\n \n archaeologists and dealers more than  years ago come to be seen as the\n \n enemy of the commercial art market? \n \n \n \n dealers and collectors argue that the state department?s professional staff\n \n has manipulated the nominations process in recent years so that a majority\n \n of committee members at any given time lean toward broad import\n \n restrictions. archaeologists counter that unscrupulous dealers are still\n \n only too happy to profit from looting by selling items of ambiguous origins,\n \n and that import restrictions are an important tool for reining them in.\n \n \n \n at the same time it is clear that recent restitution battles by countries\n \n like italy and egypt have sensitized american officials and the public to\n \n the principle of cultural patrimony, the idea that each nation has a right\n \n to possess and protect its historical treasures.\n \n \n \n the united states government currently has agreements with  nations to\n \n restrict the import of culturally significant artifacts. to this day it has\n \n never failed to grant an initial request for import controls. \n \n \n \n but current requests have collectors and dealers up in arms. they argue that\n \n china?s petition is so broad that it would include  ceramics\n \n that were mass-produced for export. and cyprus is asking that an existing\n \n ban on imports of classical and byzantine material be expanded to include\n \n ancient coins, a category of artifacts that has not been included in other\n \n import restrictions. \n \n \n \n ms. palmer argues that congress intended the committee to protect only the\n \n most significant artifacts from pillage, not grant broad restrictions on the\n \n import of entire categories of objects. james fitzpatrick, a lawyer who has\n \n represented dealers and collectors before the committee, agrees. ?there is\n \n no attempt by c.p.a.c. today to differentiate between items of great\n \n significance and those that are produced in the hundreds or multiple\n \n hundreds of items,? he said. \n \n \n \n but archaeologists say that the import restrictions have been critical in\n \n highlighting the problem posed by looting. ?it has proven to be a fairly\n \n effective tool for raising awareness of looting because the u.s. is such a\n \n large art market,? said ricardo elia, an archaeologist at boston university.\n \n \n \n \n \n renata holod, a curator at the university of pennsylvania museum of\n \n archaeology and anthropology, said many ancient sites in iraq and elsewhere\n \n now look like ?a moonscape? because of all the illicit digging. ?that is a\n \n feature of the existence of a market in antiquities,? she said drily. while\n \n the american restrictions do not stop pillaging completely, she added, they\n \n do send a message to the rest of the world that the united states opposes\n \n the destruction of other countries? cultural property. \n \n \n \n in many cases, archaeologists say, western museums have been willing to turn\n \n a blind eye to murky provenances if they could get their hands on uniquely\n \n beautiful or rare artifacts. in recent years institutions like the j. paul\n \n getty museum and the metropolitan museum of art have agreed to return\n \n objects to their countries of origin after being confronted with evidence\n \n that the artifacts had been exported illegally.\n \n \n \n but dealers and museum curators reply that they oppose looting too, and that\n \n archaeologists fail to see that an object?s aesthetic value and its\n \n safekeeping are at least as important as its cultural or historical\n \n significance. \n \n \n \n some dealers say that archaeologists harbor class resentments of monied\n \n collectors and are uncomfortable with the idea that history can have a\n \n price. \n \n \n \n ?in a lot of anti-collecting bashing or museum bashing that goes on there is\n \n always a background of quasi-socialist sentiment,? said william pearlstein,\n \n a lawyer at golenbock eisenman assor bell  peskoe in new york who has\n \n represented art dealers. ?you always hear archaeologists hissing about\n \n money.?\n \n \n \n that collision of worldviews was on vivid display on march  in a\n \n conference room in washington where the committee held a public hearing. the\n \n issue was an extension of import restrictions on objects from guatemala and\n \n mali. speaking in favor was david friedel, an archaeologist at southern\n \n methodist university who has carried out excavations of maya ruins there. \n \n \n \n with barely restrained disgust he told the panel that a single olmec\n \n serpentine figure might bring  at christie?s auction house. ripped\n \n from its context in a maya tomb, however, its testimony to how the maya\n \n venerated the earlier olmec civilization would be lost, he said.\n \n \n \n later in the hearing claire hilmer, representing the nonprofit group saving\n \n antiquities for everyone, expressed dismay at the high prices ancient\n \n statuary from mali brought at auction. that prompted pointed questioning\n \n from james willis, a dealer in african art who is one of the sales experts\n \n on the committee. \n \n \n \n ?do you think it is a good or a bad thing that these things are worth the\n \n millions that you say they are?? he asked. ?if there were no international\n \n market and these wealthy people willing to spend this money on these\n \n figurines, what would happen to them? if those objects had little to no\n \n value, do you think they would survive??\n \n \n \n under the current law a foreign nation must meet certain criteria to obtain\n \n restrictions. it must document the extent to which pillaging jeopardizes\n \n important cultural sites and objects. it must provide evidence that it is\n \n combating looting inside its borders. it must establish that the american\n \n market in these objects is large enough to warrant more control and that\n \n other methods to address looting are not available. and the law says that in\n \n most cases import limits should be created only if other nations are\n \n imposing similar restrictions, so that american dealers and collectors are\n \n not unfairly disadvantaged. the committee investigates whether these\n \n criteria have been met and issues a recommendation to the state department,\n \n which makes the final decision. the department almost never fails to follow\n \n the recommendation. \n \n \n \n by law the committee consists of  unpaid members appointed by the\n \n president: three each from the art trade and archaeologists, three who\n \n represent the wider public and two who represent the interests of museums.\n \n \n \n but this system has gone awry, according to dealers, collectors, former\n \n committee members and others familiar with the committee?s workings. while\n \n nominally balanced, they say, in practice a number of the museum and public\n \n representatives on the panel have been drawn from the archaeological camp. \n \n \n \n for instance, the most recent museum representatives on the panel both came\n \n from the field museum in chicago. unlike many other top museums in the\n \n united states, the field sponsors archaeological digs and no longer\n \n purchases items on the art market. asked about the balance on the committee,\n \n the state department referred that question to the white house. citing a\n \n policy of not commenting on personnel matters, a white house spokeswoman,\n \n emily lawrimore, declined to explain how the president chooses nominees.\n \n \n \n \n \n the committee?s critics also say state department lawyers have used\n \n conflict-of-interest rules to nudge the committee toward import\n \n restrictions. james lally, the noted new york dealer in asian art, declined\n \n a seat on the panel in  after state department lawyers told him he would\n \n not be able to discuss or vote on any petition from a country in whose art\n \n he traded. ?i was approved after a long process of investigation,? he said,\n \n ?and then they said, ?oh well, you cannot speak about any asian art.? this\n \n made less than no sense. this is a perversion of the intent of the law.? \n \n \n \n archaeologists, on the other hand, have not been asked to recuse themselves\n \n from deliberations or votes involving countries where they have taken part\n \n in excavations. yet dealers protest that these are also conflicts of\n \n interest, since archaeologists must rely on the good favor of these foreign\n \n governments to receive continued permission to dig.\n \n \n \n the committee has also been faulted for its secrecy. the state department\n \n classifies almost all material presented to the group to aid its\n \n deliberations, including press clippings and information available on the\n \n internet. it also withholds the original petitions for import restrictions\n \n that foreign countries submit as well as the recommendations that the\n \n committee makes to the department. \n \n \n \n committee members are also told they cannot independently investigate the\n \n facts related to a country?s petition or discuss the matter with outside\n \n experts apart from those who appear at the committee?s infrequent hearings.\n \n \n \n patty gerstenblith, who is chairman of the archaeological institute of\n \n america?s cultural property legislation committee and served as a public\n \n representative on the committee from  to  said she saw good reason\n \n for the secrecy. she said that as a committee member, she might have felt\n \n inhibited from speaking candidly in deliberations if she thought her\n \n comments might later become public. \n \n \n \n she also said information presented to the committee might, if released,\n \n ?become a road map for looters? interested in pillaging sites. \n \n \n \n but the committee?s current chairman, jay kislak, a real estate magnate and\n \n collector of pre-colombian artifacts, bristles at the secrecy under which\n \n the state department has the panel work. \n \n \n \n ?in my opinion the restrictions, regulations and lack of transparency under\n \n which we are asked to operate in pursuing our duties at c.p.a.c. are to say\n \n the least unusual, and in many cases they are unbearable, immoral and maybe\n \n either extra-legal or in contradiction? of the law, he said. \n \n \n \n c. miller crouch, deputy assistant secretary of state for educational and\n \n cultural affairs, said that the law that created the committee explicitly\n \n exempted it from public disclosure requirements that apply to similar\n \n federal advisory committees.\n \n \n \n given the secrecy surrounding the panel?s deliberations, it is difficult to\n \n predict how the state department will rule on china?s request. what is\n \n certain is that the controversy over the committee is not going away. with\n \n looting on the rise worldwide, according to interpol, the number of\n \n countries requesting import restrictions is only likely to grow, and the\n \n clash between archaeologists and collectors will continue. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ------------------------------\n \n \n \n  \n msn-list mailing list\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n end of msn-list digest, vol  issue  \n  \n \n \n ',ham

central\'s \"the daily show with jon\n \n stewart.\"\n \n \n \n  \n political hot topics\n \n (today\'s top political stories from news organizations across the country)\n \n \n \n stuck under  president bush is reaching levels of consistency that no white house would want. bush\'s job-approval\n \n rating in a usa  poll taken monday through thursday is  his standing has stayed below  for seven\n \n consecutive months. since the advent of modern polling, only two presidents have suffered longer strings of such low\n \n ratings. one was harry truman, whose popularity sank during the final  months of his tenure as the korean war\n \n stalemated. the other was richard nixon during the  months leading up to his resignation amid the watergate scandal.\n \n \"it\'s pretty hard for a president to get ratings this low in general, and then to be in the position where you\n \n basically don\'t budge - that\'s been reserved for some of the least popular presidents during the worst times of the\n \n last  years,\" says jeffrey jones of the gallup poll, who analyzed the historic data. usa today: bush\'s approval\n \n rating sits below   \n \n \n \"fresh speech,\" renewed push on immigration: president bush will relaunch his push for an overhaul of the nation\'s\n \n immigration laws today in arizona, with a fresh speech on the border and a new congressional leadership that is\n \n friendlier to his views, but with the same dynamics that scuttled his last attempt: a cooperative senate but bipartisan\n \n opposition in the house. in contrast to her approach to other controversial issues, house speaker nancy pelosi\n \n (d-calif.) has told the white house that she cannot pass a bill with democratic votes alone, nor will she seek to\n \n enforce party discipline on the issue. bush will have to produce at least  republican votes before she considers a\n \n vote on comprehensive immigration legislation, a task that may be very difficult for a president saddled with low\n \n approval ratings. washington post: president renewing efforts on immigration\n \n  \n \n \n dems won\'t \"cut funding, period,\" says levin: two leading senate democrats said their party will not cut off funding\n \n for u.s. troops in iraq, distancing themselves from senate majority leader harry reid, nevada democrat, who now says he\n \n supports doing so. \"we\'re not going to vote to cut funding, period,\" said sen. carl levin, michigan democrat and armed\n \n services committee chairman. mr. levin said he and other democrats would continue to pressure president bush on\n \n enforcing benchmarks for progress in iraq, but ultimately most of his colleagues will support funding because they do\n \n not have the votes to override mr. bush\'s veto... sen. charles e. schumer, new york democrat, echoed mr. levin\'s\n \n comments on troop funding, telling \"fox news sunday\" that \"we are not going to leave the troops high and dry, plain and\n \n simple. senator reid has said that. i\'ve said that. every leader of the democratic party has said that.\" washington\n \n times: senate democrats say they won\'t halt funding for troops\n \n  \n \n \n dems seek to \"upstage\" gop with alternative minimum tax change: house democratic leaders, in an effort to upstage\n \n republicans on the issue of tax cuts, are preparing legislation that would permanently shield all but the very richest\n \n taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, which is likely to affect tens of millions of families as early as next\n \n year if it is left unchanged. the effort, which lawmakers emphasize is still in its early stages, would exempt millions\n \n of people from the tax but would have to come up with a way to offset an enormous loss of revenue in the next decade.\n \n measured in dollars, it would be far bigger than democratic initiatives to provide money for children\'s health care,\n \n education or any other spending program. new york times: democrats seek to lead the way in tax overhaul\n \n  \n \n \n gingrich calls for \"new team\" at doj: former house speaker newt gingrich on sunday became the latest republican to\n \n criticize attorney general alberto r. gonzales for the dismissals of eight united states attorneys, and he said mr.\n \n gonzales should consider stepping down. \"this is the most mishandled, artificial, self-created mess that i can remember\n \n in the years, in the years i\'ve been active in public life,\" mr. gingrich said on \"fox news sunday.\" \"you know, the\n \n buck has to stop somewhere, and i\'m assuming it\'s the attorney general and his immediate team,\" he said. asked whether\n \n mr. gonzales should resign, mr. gingrich replied, \"i cannot imagine how he is going to be effective for the rest of\n \n this administration.\" new york times: gingrich faults gonzales for attorneys \'mess\'\n \n  \n \n \n \"he\'s not ready\": attorney general alberto gonzales has virtually wiped his public schedule clean to bone up for his\n \n long-awaited april  testimony before the senate judiciary committee - a session widely seen as a crucial test as to\n \n whether he will survive the u.s. attorney mess. but even his own closest advisers are nervous about whether he is up to\n \n the task. at a recent \"prep\" for a prospective sunday talk-show interview, gonzales\'s performance was so poor that top\n \n aides scrapped any live appearances. during the march  session in the a.g.\'s conference room, gonzales was grilled by\n \n a team of top aides and advisers—including former republican national committee chair ed gillespie and former white\n \n house lawyer tim flanigan- about what he knew about the plan to fire seven u.s. attorneys last fall. but gonzales kept\n \n contradicting himself and \"getting his timeline confused,\" said one participant who asked not to be identified talking\n \n about a private meeting. newsweek: gonzales crams for a senate grilling\n \n  \n \n \n gop may have a laptop problem: when karl rove and his top deputies arrived at the white house in  the republican\n \n national committee provided them with laptop computers and other communication devices to be used alongside their\n \n government-issued equipment. the back-channel e-mail and paging system, paid for and maintained by the rnc, was\n \n designed to avoid charges that had vexed the clinton white house - that federal resources were being used\n \n inappropriately for political campaign purposes. now, that dual computer system is creating new embarrassment and legal\n \n headaches for the white house, the republican party and rove\'s once-vaunted white house operation. democrats say\n \n evidence suggests the rnc e-mail system was used for political and government policy matters in violation of federal\n \n record preservation and disclosure rules. los angeles times: gop-issued laptops now a white house headache\n \n  \n \n \n mccain only top-tier  who\'s served in uniform: the  presidential campaign is long on war rhetoric and short\n \n on warriors. despite the high-profile roles of the battle against terrorism and conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in\n \n the presidential campaign, few of the candidates can claim military experience on their resumes. of the top tier of\n \n  candidates, only republican john mccain has been to war and served in uniform. yet, while the demand for a\n \n president with a military background might be expected to run high in the post-sept.  era, few see that as a\n \n determining factor in the  race. ap via yahoo! news: most  candidates lack military record\n \n  \n \n \n richardson in north korea: bill richardson, the new mexico governor who has undertaken diplomatic missions to countries\n \n at odds with the united states, began a rare visit to isolated north korea sunday to recover remains of american\n \n servicemen killed in the korean war. the four-day trip, which has been endorsed by the bush administration, comes days\n \n before a crucial deadline in a recent nuclear disarmament accord. earlier, richardson, a democratic candidate for\n \n president, had said he had no intention of negotiating nuclear matters. on monday, richardson met with north korea\'s\n \n top nuclear negotiator, who said his government would immediately invite u.n. nuclear inspectors into the country if\n \n  million in disputed north korean funds are released to pyongyang. ap via yahoo! news: richardson on rare visit to\n \n north korea  \n \n \n edwards courts unions: for john edwards, the road to the presidency runs through alan young, a teachers\' union official\n \n in des moines, iowa. the former north carolina senator\'s strategy for winning the democratic nomination is to knock off\n \n one of the two front- runners, senators hillary clinton and barack obama, in the early primudles and make the next\n \n round a head-to-head contest. to do that, he is focusing his campaign efforts on labor. \"one thing union members know\n \n how to do is organize,\" edwards,  who sought the presidential nomination in  and then became the democratic vice\n \n presidential choice, said in an interview last week. bloomberg: edwards bets on union support to grab momentum in early\n \n races  \n \n \n \"tennessee mafia\" would jump behind thompson bid: if fred thompson decides to run for president, he will have some\n \n powerful supporters: the self-described \"tennessee mafia,\" a group of republican politicians from his home state\n \n well-versed in the craft of national campaigns. what the actor and former senator may lack is the financial juice that\n \n fired the group for more than a quarter century, driving local and national campaigns with astonishing amounts of cash.\n \n \"mafia\" members include howard baker, a former republican senator, ambassador and white house chief of staff, who\n \n himself ran for president in  sen. lamar alexander, a former two-term tennessee governor who ran for president in\n \n  and  and bill frist, the former senate republican majority leader, who considered, then rejected his own run\n \n for the white house

vacate after  terms has one new, major obstacle: he probably won\'t be able to campaign personally. mr.\n \n hunter, a  marine who has served two tours in iraq, last week was recalled to active duty and expects to be\n \n in iraq or afghanistan when the election to replace his father, republican presidential aspirant rep. duncan hunter,\n \n occurs. but regardless of where his april  deployment

backs \"dog\": call it the \"dog\" plank in the presidential platform of rep. tom tancredo, r-colo. the\n \n conservative congressman has been at the forefront of the effort to prevent the extradition of bounty hunter and\n \n reality tv star duane \"dog\" chapman and his brother and son to mexico on a deprivation of liberty charge. now, tancredo\n \n has made it a part of his presidential campaign. tancredo recently sent a letter to the mexican government protesting\n \n the action, and his campaign site now sports a form that allows users to add their name to the letter and \"let my\n

french  bayonne, pronounced   gascon occitan and basque  baiona  is a\n \n city and commune of southwest france at the confluence of the nive and adour\n \n rivers, in the pyr  n  es atlantiques   partements of    \n of which it is a  pr   \n \n \n together with nearby anglet, biarritz, saint jean de luz, and several smaller\n \n communes, bayonne forms an urban area with  inhabitants at the  \n census,  of whom lived in the city of bayonne proper   as of  \n estimates .\n \n \n \n the communes of bayonne, biarritz, and anglet have joined into an intercommunal\n \n entity called the    d agglom  ration de bayonne anglet  \n \n \n bayonne is the main town of labourd in the french basque country.\n \n \n \n history\n \n \n \n in the  century ad, the area was the site of a roman  named\n \n lapurdum. it was a military place, but not a port. in  the vikings appeared\n \n before lapurdum. in  they launched a large scale inland offensive and\n \n settled outside the city on the river bank. lapurdum was an oppidum and they\n \n needed a port. bayonne  from basque bai  river   became a key place on the route\n \n between the adour and ebro rivers, which served as a kind of link between the\n \n atlantic and the mediterranean. this commercial route was the main goal of\n \n danish invaders in france. by this route, they could easily reach tortosa, which\n \n was the main marketplace in europe dealing with slaves.\n \n \n \n by the  century the city was an important port, with a mixed basque and\n \n gascon population. as part of aquitaine, it was ruled by england between  to\n \n  and was a key commercial centre at the southern end of the english kingdom.\n \n \n \n its importance waned somewhat when the french king, charles vii, took the city\n \n at the end of the hundred years  war and the adour changed course shortly\n \n afterwards, leaving bayonne without its access to the sea. the french, however,\n \n realised bayonne s strategic site near the spanish border and in  dug a\n \n canal to redirect the river through the city once again.\n \n \n \n bayonne endured numerous sieges from plantagenet times until the end of the\n \n first french empire in  in the  century, vauban built large\n \n fortifications and the citadelle in and around the city. these proved crucial in\n \n  and  when wellington s army besieged the city in the napoleonic wars,\n \n only taking it when they used a bridge of ships across the adour to position\n \n artillery around the city.\n \n \n \n bayonne s location close to the border, but also within the basque country\n \n straddling both france and spain, gave it an often privileged position in\n \n commerce. basque sailors travelled the world, bringing back products such as\n \n cinnamon and riches from piracy and the whaling and cod trades. an armaments\n \n industry developed, giving the world the  bayonet . jewish refugees from the\n \n spanish inquisition from  brought new trades, most notably chocolate making,\n \n which is still important in bayonne. spanish basques also sought refuge in\n \n bayonne in the  century during francisco franco s repression, with petit\n \n bayonne still a centre of basque nationalism.\n \n \n \n by the mid  century, bayonne had declined somewhat with the centralisation\n \n of power to paris and to the new   partements of    \n capital, non basque pau, after the  french revolution, and with wellington s\n \n bombardment. however, rail links with paris from  and the growing touristic\n \n importance of nearby biarritz brought industrialisation and development. bayonne\n \n is now part of  bab   bayonne anglet biarritz , a metropolitan area of almost\n \n  people.\n \n \n \n description\n \n \n \n the nive divides bayonne into grand bayonne and petit bayonne, with five bridges\n \n between the two, both quarters still backed by vauban s walls. indeed the nive\n \n is more like a main street, with many restaurants, squares and the covered\n \n market on its quays. the houses lining the nive are picturesque examples of\n \n basque architecture, with half timbering and shutters in the national colours of\n \n red and green. the much wider adour is to the north. the pont st esprit connects\n \n petit bayonne with the quartier st esprit across the adour, where the massive\n \n citadelle and the railway station are located.\n \n \n \n grand bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets\n \n packed with shops, plus the cathedral and h  tel de ville. the cath  drale ste \n \n mudle is an imposing, elegant gothic building, rising over the houses, glimpsed\n \n along the narrow streets. it was constructed in the  and  centuries. the\n \n south tower was completed in the  century but the cathedral was only\n \n completed in the  century with the north tower. the cathedral is noted for\n \n its charming cloisters. there are other details and sculptures of note, although\n \n much was destroyed in the revolution. nearby is the ch  teau vieux, some of\n \n which dates back to the  century, where the governors of the city were\n \n based, including the english black prince.\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n      \n   \n    \n  \n  \n              \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n ',spam

 or propose a better alternative? \n \n \n \n -- \n \n gregory (greg) l. snow ph.d.\n \n statistical data center\n \n intermountain healthcare\n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  -----original message-----\n \n  from: olivier eterradossi  \n \n  sent: friday, april    am\n \n  to: greg snow\n \n  cc:  \n  subject: re:  generate a serie of new vars that correlate \n \n  withexistingvar\n \n  \n \n  hello greg (and list),\n \n  thnaks for your reply and reflections (and sorry for my \n \n  \"frenglish\"....).\n \n  of course you\'re right, and i agree \"a posteriori\" with all \n \n  your views. \n \n  probably my suggestion was first of all a mark of \n \n  appreciation for your solution ;-) .\n \n  here is the path i followed to get where i was, but i see \n \n  that i was probably misunderstanding what makes the \"core\" of r :\n \n   the question of making such related couples of vectors is \n \n  nearly a faq, as you point out in your reply.\n \n   it appeared to me that it is often asked by newbies or \n \n  users with relatively small statistical knowledge.\n \n   to get to your solution, a good understanding is needed of \n \n  what correlation is, as well as of matrix properties and \n \n  operators. my guess was that the people listed above have \n \n  generally not.\n \n   i believed from my own experience that the core of r was \n \n  dedicated either to basics or to rather complicated \n \n  algorithms to handle or produce results appearing as \"simple\" \n \n  or \"classical\".\n \n   from my same own experience, i was not able to imagine to \n \n  which non-core package such a function should \"obviously\" be \n \n  added. i imagined that in the same manner, a person seeking \n \n  for the function could have some problems in locating it. \n \n  until now i did not have a look to your teachingdemos package \n \n  (i\'ll do it), but i know of other categories of searchers, \n \n  often not statisticians, who  have a need to generate such \n \n  data and would not think of getting there to find a way.\n \n  to end with, all this mainly shows that i did not understand \n \n  r philosophy as well as i thought !\n \n  thanks, and regards. olivier\n \n  \n \n  greg snow a écrit :\n \n   oliver,\n \n   \n   i have thought of adding something like this to a package, \n \n  but here is my current thinking on the issue.\n \n   \n   this question (or similar) has been asked a few times, so \n \n  there is some demand for a general answer, i see three approaches:\n \n   \n    have an example of the necessary steps archived in a \n \n  publicly available place.\n \n    write a function and include it in a non-core package.\n \n    add it to the core of r or a core package.\n \n   \n   number  is already in process as the e-mails will be part \n \n  of the archive.  though someone is welcome to add it to the \n \n  wiki if they think that would be useful as well.\n \n   \n   your suggestion is number  but i would argue that  is \n \n  better than  for the simple reason that anything added to \n \n  the core is implied to be top quality and have pretty much \n \n  any options that most people would think of.  putting it in a \n \n  non-core package makes it available, with less implications \n \n  of quality.\n \n   \n   the question then becomes, what options do we make \n \n  available?  do we have them specify the entire correlation \n \n  structure? or just assume the new variables will be \n \n  independent of each other?  what should the function do if \n \n  the set of correlations result in a matrix that is not \n \n  positive definite?  what if the user wants to have  fixed \n \n  variables?  and other questions.\n \n   \n   my current thinking is that the process is simple enough \n \n  that it is easier to do this by hand than to remember all the \n \n  options to the function.  there are currently people who use \n \n  bootstrap and permutation tests without loading in the \n \n  packages that do these because it is quicker to write the \n \n  code by hand than to remember the syntax of the functions.  i \n \n  think this type of data generation falls under the same \n \n  situation.  but if you, or someone else thinks that there is \n \n  enough justification for a function to do this, and can \n \n  specify what options it should have, i will be happy to add \n \n  it to my teachingdemos package (this seems an appropriate \n \n  place, since one of the places that i want to generate data \n \n  with a specific correlation structure is when creating an \n \n  example for students).\n \n   \n   \n   hope this helps,\n \n   \n     \n \n  \n \n  --\n \n  olivier eterradossi\n \n  maître-assistant\n \n  cmgd  equipe \"propriétés psycho-sensorielles des matériaux\"\n \n  ecole des mines d\'alès\n \n  hélioparc,  av. p. angot,  pau cedex  tel std:  \n \n   tel direct:   \n  fax:   \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  mailing list\n \n  \n please do read the posting guide  \n and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n \n \n ',ham

are the two necessarily contradictory? is it logical to take different positions for different types of intellectual outputs?\n \n \n \n while the argument for property rights favours financial gain as the best incentive, the contrary view is that strong iprs inhibit innovation and development of new technologies with implications for biodiversity and concerns for the poor making medicines more expensive or farmers\' seeds ineffective.\n \n \n \n ipr issues are often seen as developed versus developing country positions the former with strong aggressive interests and the latter with more defensive interests. the balance of power is in favour of industrial lobbies in developed countries that have successfully increased the breadth and coverage of iprs from trade secrets, utility models, and broadcasting rights to rights on data compilation.\n \n \n \n however, the positions can well be reversed as in the case of traditional knowledge. iprs do not have to be all or nothing. it is possible to take differing positions depending on the \'public good\' nature of the product. the challenge lies in finding ways to balance rewards to the innovator while facilitating wider access and dissemination to spur further innovation and newer applications.\n \n \n \n for instance, biotechnologies are at the cutting edge - in the laboratory and commercially. the original species for this research comes mainly from tropical countries rich in biodiversity. corporations patent these resources after getting them from poor communities.\n \n \n \n the us patent on turmeric for healing wounds is an example. while most corporations in the business see it as bio-prospecting, and demand strong iprs, for poor communities this is bio-piracy as they lose out on fees worth millions of dollars for prospecting rights.\n \n \n \n adding value to traditional knowledge through geographical indications (gis), is an excellent opportunity for developing countries to aggressively leverage commercial gains from ip. a gi identifies a good as originating in a specific region, with quality or characteristics attribu-table to its geographic origin.\n \n \n \n most gis are used for relative luxuries like wine, spirits and cheese. traditional knowledge can push the use of gi beyond luxury goods and whole communities can benefit. examples are basmati rice of india and pakistan, tea from sri lanka, phu quoc fish sauce and hunza apricots. another idea not yet utilised is gi in services like thai massages and asian hospitality.\n \n \n \n a major area of concern is the implication for drug prices with the strengthening of iprs in pharma-ceuticals. the cost of essential drugs is much lower in india than in neighbouring pakistan - with different intellectual property regimes.\n \n \n \n india has historically had \'process\' patents, not \'product\' patents, allowing domestic pharmaceutical companies to produce low-priced copies of patented drugs. this simple provision in the original indian patents act  increased competition and put pressure on pharma-ceutical companies to keep prices low.\n \n \n \n india is the fourth largest producer of pharmaceuticals and a large supplier of low-cost generic drugs to other developing countries. as a signatory to the trips agreement india was under pressure to modify its ip laws, to change to a \'product\' patents regime. a  amendment to the indian patents act made the country wto compliant but this was later reversed under intense domestic pressure.\n \n \n \n arts and entertainment is one area where the argument of public good for human well-being need not be an issue. music, painting and film are the works of specific artists who should be compensated for the use of their work. strong iprs in these areas is less likely to compromise social good.\n \n \n \n the writer is with undp.\n \n --\n \n  attachments.zip of type  deleted  \n --\n \n \n \n  \n ip-health mailing list\n \n  \n  \n \n \n ',ham

expected to\n \n attend the meeting.\n \n \n \n the session will be the second round of meetings.\n \n \n \n the first round, which was held late last month, ended inconclusively as\n \n the pharmaceutical firms told negotiators they had to discuss the matter\n \n with their parent companies.\n \n \n \n previously, the fda had informed the patent holders that the state was\n \n willing to compensate them with only  of the revenue generated from\n \n the generic drug sales. this was in keeping with article  of the\n \n patent law, he said.\n \n \n \n the public health ministry issued compulsory licences in november and\n \n early january to produce or import generic versions of the costly drugs\n \n for emergency use in the country.\n \n \n \n however, abbott bluntly rejected any offer, claiming such a state policy\n \n would only jeopardise its research and development plans for new drugs.\n \n the us-based drug company earlier opposed the government\'s decision to\n \n go for compulsory licensing and threatened to withhold the introduction\n \n of new drugs here, including an improved version of kaletra.\n \n \n \n in february, the drug company made an offer during a meeting with senior\n \n health officials at the disease control department to cut the price of\n \n kaletra used at state hospitals from  baht per patient per month\n \n to lower than  baht. there has been no further discussion on the offer.\n \n \n \n \"the state has to be responsible for all patients suffering from\n \n  and heart disease, while the private firms have to stick to the\n \n principle of profit making. our standpoints are different. that\'s why we\n \n have to discuss this to seek the most acceptable solution for both\n \n sides,\" said dr siriwat.\n \n \n \n kaletra\'s global sales total  billion  billion baht) annually.\n \n \n \n however, the fda secretary-general said he was not worried about\n \n resolute standpoint and that health officials were looking for other\n \n options of pharmaceutical products made by the company.\n \n \n \n representatives of both msd and sanofi have told the fda all their\n \n decisions would come from discussions with their mother companies.\n \n \n \n so far, msd has offered to reduce the price of efavirenz to  baht per\n \n bottle, but the government can buy the generic version of the\n \n anti-retroviral treatment from india at just  baht per bottle.\n \n \n \n sanofi-aventis, however, has offered a \"special package\" for the heart\n \n disease drug to respond to the government\'s policy of extending access\n \n to medicines, and a special quota of  million tablets of plavix for\n \n  patients in thailand.\n \n \n \n dr siriwat said the government also planned to ask novartis to reduce\n \n the price of gleevec, a leukaemia treatment, instead of adopting a\n \n philanthropic programme in order to genuinely extend drug access for\n \n patients suffering from cancer.\n \n \n \n --\n \n mike palmedo\n

on my laptop\n \n and home computers i have r installed.  so, if a deadline is looming and\n \n i am working on a project mainly in r, it is easy to work on it on the\n \n bus or at home (or in a boring meeting), the same does not work for a\n \n sas or spss project (hmm, thinking about this now, maybe i need to do\n \n less in r :-).\n \n \n \n r and s-plus are very  if you have a certain plot\n \n that you make often you can write your own  to do it\n \n automatically, most other programs will give you their standard, then\n \n you have to modify it to meet your specifications.  with sweave (and the\n \n odf and html extensions) you can automate whole reports, very useful for\n \n things that you do month after month.\n \n \n \n and what i think is the biggest advantage of r and s-plus is that they\n \n strongly encourage you to think about your data.  other programs (at\n \n least that i am familiar with) tend to have  specific way of treating\n \n your data, and expect you to modify your data to fit that programs\n \n model.  these models can be overrestrictive (force you to restructure\n \n your data to fit their model) or underrestrictive (allow things that\n \n should really be separate data objects to be combined into a single\n \n \"dataset\") and sometimes both.  s on the other hand allows many\n \n different ways to store and work with your data, and as you analyze the\n \n data, different branches of new analysis open up depending on early\n \n results rather than just getting stock output for a procedure.  if all\n \n you want is a black box where data goes in one end and a specific answer\n \n comes out the other, then most programs will work; but if you want to\n \n really understand what your data has to tell you, then  makes\n \n this easy and natural.\n \n \n \n hope this helps,\n \n \n \n \n \n -- \n \n gregory (greg) l. snow ph.d.\n \n statistical data center\n \n intermountain healthcare\n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  -----original message-----\n \n  from:  \n \n   on behalf of lorenzo isella\n \n  sent: thursday, april    am\n \n  to:  \n  subject:  reasons to use r\n \n  \n \n  dear all,\n \n  the institute i work for is organizing an internal workshop \n \n  for high performance computing (hpc).\n \n  i am planning to attend it and talk a bit about fluid \n \n  dynamics, but there is also quite a lot of interest devoted \n \n  to data post-processing and management of huge data sets.\n \n  a lot of people are interested in image  \n \n  recognition and statistic applied to  but i \n \n  would like not to post this on too many lists.\n \n  the final aim of the workshop is  understanding hardware \n \n  requirements and drafting a list of the equipment we would \n \n  like to buy. i think this could be the venue to talk about r as well.\n \n  therefore, even if it is not exactly a typical mailing list \n \n  question, i would like to have suggestions about where to \n \n  collect info about:\n \n   (not only academia) using r  \n \n  requirements, possibly benchmarks   clusters, r  \n \n  multiple cpu machines, r performance on different hardware.\n \n   a list of the advantages for using r over \n \n  commercial statistical packages. the money-saving in itself \n \n  is not a reason good enough and some people are scared by the \n \n  lack of professional support, though this mailing list is \n \n  simply wonderful.\n \n  \n \n  kind regards\n \n  \n \n  lorenzo isella\n \n  \n \n   \n   mailing list\n \n   \n  please do read the posting guide \n \n   \n  and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n  \n \n \n  \n  mailing list\n \n  \n please do read the posting guide  \n and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n \n \n ',ham

on my laptop\n \n  and home computers i have r installed.  so, if a deadline is looming and\n \n  i am working on a project mainly in r, it is easy to work on it on the\n \n  bus or at home (or in a boring meeting), the same does not work for a\n \n  sas or spss project (hmm, thinking about this now, maybe i need to do\n \n  less in r :-).\n \n  \n  r and s-plus are very  if you have a certain plot\n \n  that you make often you can write your own  to do it\n \n  automatically, most other programs will give you their standard, then\n \n  you have to modify it to meet your specifications.  with sweave (and the\n \n  odf and html extensions) you can automate whole reports, very useful for\n \n  things that you do month after month.\n \n  \n  and what i think is the biggest advantage of r and s-plus is that they\n \n  strongly encourage you to think about your data.  other programs (at\n \n  least that i am familiar with) tend to have  specific way of treating\n \n  your data, and expect you to modify your data to fit that programs\n \n  model.  these models can be overrestrictive (force you to restructure\n \n  your data to fit their model) or underrestrictive (allow things that\n \n  should really be separate data objects to be combined into a single\n \n  \"dataset\") and sometimes both.  s on the other hand allows many\n \n  different ways to store and work with your data, and as you analyze the\n \n  data, different branches of new analysis open up depending on early\n \n  results rather than just getting stock output for a procedure.  if all\n \n  you want is a black box where data goes in one end and a specific answer\n \n  comes out the other, then most programs will work; but if you want to\n \n  really understand what your data has to tell you, then  makes\n \n  this easy and natural.\n \n  \n  hope this helps,\n \n  \n  \n  --\n \n  gregory (greg) l. snow ph.d.\n \n  statistical data center\n \n  intermountain healthcare\n \n   \n    \n  \n  \n  \n   -----original message-----\n \n   from:  \n    on behalf of lorenzo isella\n \n   sent: thursday, april    am\n \n   to:  \n   subject:  reasons to use r\n \n   \n   dear all,\n \n   the institute i work for is organizing an internal workshop\n \n   for high performance computing (hpc).\n \n   i am planning to attend it and talk a bit about fluid\n \n   dynamics, but there is also quite a lot of interest devoted\n \n   to data post-processing and management of huge data sets.\n \n   a lot of people are interested in image  \n   recognition and statistic applied to  but i\n \n   would like not to post this on too many lists.\n \n   the final aim of the workshop is  understanding hardware\n \n   requirements and drafting a list of the equipment we would\n \n   like to buy. i think this could be the venue to talk about r as well.\n \n   therefore, even if it is not exactly a typical mailing list\n \n   question, i would like to have suggestions about where to\n \n   collect info about:\n \n    (not only academia) using r  \n   requirements, possibly benchmarks   clusters, r  \n   multiple cpu machines, r performance on different hardware.\n \n    a list of the advantages for using r over\n \n   commercial statistical packages. the money-saving in itself\n \n   is not a reason good enough and some people are scared by the\n \n   lack of professional support, though this mailing list is\n \n   simply wonderful.\n \n   \n   kind regards\n \n   \n   lorenzo isella\n \n   \n    \n    mailing list\n \n    \n   please do read the posting guide\n \n    \n   and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n   \n  \n   \n   mailing list\n \n   \n  please do read the posting guide  \n  and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n  \n \n \n  \n  mailing list\n \n  \n please do read the posting guide  \n and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n \n \n ',ham

difference is that do.call() operates (in the above example) as\n \n  if\n \n  the actual call was:\n \n  \n \n      \n     id math reading\n \n             \n            na\n \n            na\n \n  \n \n  in other words, do.call() takes the quoted function and passes the\n \n list\n \n  object as if it was a list of individual arguments. so rbind() is only\n \n  called once.\n \n  \n \n  in this case, rbind() internally handles all of the factor level\n \n  issues,\n \n  etc. to enable a single common data frame to be created from the three\n \n  independent data frames contained in \'mylast\':\n \n  \n \n   str(mylast)\n \n  list of  \n         obs. of   variables:\n \n     id     : factor   levels   \n     math   : num  \n     reading: num  \n         obs. of   variables:\n \n     id     : factor   levels   \n     math   : num  \n     reading: num na\n \n         obs. of   variables:\n \n     id     : factor   levels   \n     math   : num  \n     reading: num na\n \n  \n \n

on \n \n  my laptop \n \n   and home computers i have r installed.  so, if a deadline \n \n  is looming \n \n   and i am working on a project mainly in r, it is easy to \n \n  work on it on \n \n   the bus or at home (or in a boring meeting), the same does not work \n \n   for a sas or spss project (hmm, thinking about this now, \n \n  maybe i need \n \n   to do less in r :-).\n \n   \n   r and s-plus are very  if you have a certain \n \n   plot that you make often you can write your own \n \n   to do \n \n   it automatically, most other programs will give you their standard, \n \n   then you have to modify it to meet your specifications.  \n \n  with sweave \n \n   (and the odf and html extensions) you can automate whole \n \n  reports, very \n \n   useful for things that you do month after month.\n \n   \n   and what i think is the biggest advantage of r and s-plus \n \n  is that they \n \n   strongly encourage you to think about your data.  other \n \n  programs (at \n \n   least that i am familiar with) tend to have  specific way \n \n  of treating \n \n   your data, and expect you to modify your data to fit that programs \n \n   model.  these models can be overrestrictive (force you to \n \n  restructure \n \n   your data to fit their model) or underrestrictive (allow \n \n  things that \n \n   should really be separate data objects to be combined into a single\n \n   \"dataset\") and sometimes both.  s on the other hand allows many \n \n   different ways to store and work with your data, and as you analyze \n \n   the data, different branches of new analysis open up depending on \n \n   early results rather than just getting stock output for a \n \n  procedure.  \n \n   if all you want is a black box where data goes in one end and a \n \n   specific answer comes out the other, then most programs \n \n  will work; but \n \n   if you want to really understand what your data has to tell \n \n  you, then \n \n    makes this easy and natural.\n \n   \n   hope this helps,\n \n   \n   \n   --\n \n   gregory (greg) l. snow ph.d.\n \n   statistical data center\n \n   intermountain healthcare\n \n    \n     \n   \n   \n   \n    -----original message-----\n \n    from:  \n \n     on behalf of lorenzo \n \n    isella\n \n    sent: thursday, april    am\n \n    to:  \n    subject:  reasons to use r\n \n    \n    dear all,\n \n    the institute i work for is organizing an internal \n \n  workshop for high \n \n    performance computing (hpc).\n \n    i am planning to attend it and talk a bit about fluid \n \n  dynamics, but \n \n    there is also quite a lot of interest devoted to data \n \n    post-processing and management of huge data sets.\n \n    a lot of people are interested in image  \n \n    recognition and statistic applied to  \n \n  but i would \n \n    like not to post this on too many lists.\n \n    the final aim of the workshop is  understanding hardware \n \n    requirements and drafting a list of the equipment we \n \n  would like to \n \n    buy. i think this could be the venue to talk about r as well.\n \n    therefore, even if it is not exactly a typical mailing list \n \n    question, i would like to have suggestions about where to collect \n \n    info about:\n \n     (not only academia) using r  \n \n    requirements, possibly benchmarks   clusters, r  \n \n  multiple cpu \n \n    machines, r performance on different hardware.\n \n     a list of the advantages for using r over commercial \n \n    statistical packages. the money-saving in itself is not a reason \n \n    good enough and some people are scared by the lack of \n \n  professional \n \n    support, though this mailing list is simply wonderful.\n \n    \n    kind regards\n \n    \n    lorenzo isella\n \n    \n     \n     mailing list \n \n     \n    please do read the posting guide\n \n     \n    and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n    \n   \n    \n    mailing list\n \n    \n   please do read the posting guide \n \n    \n   and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  mailing list\n \n  \n please do read the posting guide  \n and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\n \n \n \n ',ham
